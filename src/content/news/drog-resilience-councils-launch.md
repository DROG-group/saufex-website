DROG has officially launched its Resilience Council pilot programme in three municipalities across the Netherlands. The initiative brings together local government officials, educators, journalists, and civil society representatives to collaboratively identify and respond to information manipulation threats at the community level.

## What are Resilience Councils?

Resilience Councils are local, multi-stakeholder groups trained to recognise and counter foreign information manipulation and interference (FIMI). Using the EMOD training platform developed by the SAUFEX consortium, council members complete a structured learning path covering disinformation tactics, the Digital Services Act, and practical reporting procedures.

## Next steps

The pilot will run for six months, after which DROG will share findings with the broader SAUFEX consortium to inform rollouts in other partner countries.
