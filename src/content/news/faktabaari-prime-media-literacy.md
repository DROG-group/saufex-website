Our partner Faktabaari is working on a new EU-funded project called PRiME (Primary Information and Media Education). The goal is to help primary school kids aged 6-12 develop media literacy skills that actually make sense in the age of AI.

The project brings together five countries (Belgium, Spain, Austria, Germany, and Finland) and is funded by the EU's Creative Europe programme. They're building a teacher toolkit that will be available in seven languages, and they're starting by training 50+ teachers this year with plans to scale to over 500.

It's not just about teaching kids how to use technology - it's about helping them think critically about what they see online, including AI-generated content. Exactly the kind of thing we need more of.
