Our partner Faktabaari is working on a new EU-funded project called PRiME (Primary Information and Media Education). The goal is to create a flexible Media and Information Literacy framework for primary education, helping kids aged 6-12 develop skills that actually make sense in the age of AI.

The project brings together five countries (Belgium, Spain, Austria, Germany, and Finland) and is funded by the EU. The consortium is building a framework aligned with DigComp 2.2 and the EU Digital Education Action Plan, along with a teacher toolkit that will be available in seven languages. They're starting by training 50 teachers across 10 pilot schools.

It's not just about teaching kids how to use technology - it's about helping them think critically about what they see online, including AI-generated content. Exactly the kind of thing we need more of.
