Our partner DROG put out a new game with GLOBSEC and Google.org called Rig It. You build a political campaign and see how emotion and AI can be used to shape opinions and influence democracy.

It follows the same idea behind their other games like Bad News (which has had over 15 million players in 50+ countries), Go Viral!, and Harmony Square. You learn how manipulation works by trying it yourself, which makes you better at spotting it.
