Our partner DROG built a tool we think is pretty cool.

TactCheck is basically a fake social media platform running on Mastodon. Researchers can use it to study how disinformation actually spreads without having to deal with real platforms. You can load scenarios, replay real Twitter/X data, spin up AI bots, even simulate a Facebook-like environment with groups and reactions.

The whole point is to stop chasing individual false claims and start looking at the tactics instead. It's open-source so you can see exactly what's going on under the hood.

Worth a look if you work in research, policy, or media literacy: [tactcheck.com](https://tactcheck.com)
