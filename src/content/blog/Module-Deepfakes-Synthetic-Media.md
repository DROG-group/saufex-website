# Module: Deepfakes and Synthetic Media

**Purpose**: You'll learn to assess synthetic media claims accurately — understanding what's actually possible, what detection tells you, and how to avoid both panic and dismissal.

---

[screen 1]

## The Setup

A video surfaces. Someone claims it's a deepfake. Someone else insists it's authentic. Both cite "evidence." Neither provides analysis.

You need to make a judgment — or at least an informed assessment of uncertainty. How?

This module provides the framework: what deepfakes actually are, what detection actually works, and how to assess authenticity claims without overclaiming in either direction.

## What "Deepfake" Actually Means

The term gets used loosely. Let's be precise:

**Deepfakes** specifically refer to AI-generated synthetic media using deep learning neural networks. They:
- Learn from large datasets of images/video
- Generate new content that mimics the source
- Improve with training data and compute

**Not deepfakes (but often called that):**
- Basic photo editing (Photoshop)
- Simple video cuts and splices
- Out-of-context genuine footage
- CGI and special effects (different technology)

Precision matters. "Deepfake" has become a panic term. Most manipulated media isn't deepfaked.

## Current Capabilities: Realistic Assessment

What's actually possible now:

**Voice cloning:**
- High quality from relatively small samples
- Can be convincing in phone/audio-only contexts
- Real-time voice conversion exists but has tells
- **Current state**: Impressive and dangerous

**Face swapping:**
- Quality varies widely by tool and effort
- Consumer apps produce obvious fakes
- Professional tools require skill and time
- **Current state**: Variable, often detectable

**Lip-sync manipulation:**
- Making someone appear to say different words
- Improving rapidly
- Still often has artifacts on close inspection
- **Current state**: Moderate threat

**Full synthetic video:**
- Creating entirely fake scenes
- Still limited and often uncanny
- High-quality requires significant resources
- **Current state**: Early stage

## The Evidence Ladder for Synthetic Media

Classify your evidence when assessing authenticity:

**Strong signals (authentic):**
- Multiple independent recordings of same event
- Original metadata intact and verified
- Corroborating witnesses at event
- Part of continuous, unedited footage stream
- Provenance chain clearly documented

**Strong signals (synthetic):**
- Confirmed AI artifacts by technical analysis
- Source file metadata shows generation
- Creator admitted fabrication
- Multiple detection tools agree

**Medium signals:**
- Single detection tool flags as synthetic
- Some visual inconsistencies present
- Missing provenance but no positive indicators
- Contextual factors suggest manipulation motive

**Weak signals:**
- "It looks fake to me"
- "The technology exists"
- "Who benefits?" reasoning
- Claims without supporting analysis

---

[screen 5]

## Detection: What Actually Works

Technical detection approaches:

**Artifact analysis:**
- Unnatural blinking patterns (early deepfakes)
- Lighting inconsistencies on faces
- Blurred boundaries, especially hairlines
- Temporal inconsistencies (frame-to-frame)
- Audio-visual sync issues

**Metadata analysis:**
- File creation timestamps
- Device/software signatures
- Compression artifacts
- Chain of custody

**Provenance tracking:**
- First appearance of content
- Who posted and when
- Platform verification (if available)
- Cross-referencing with known events

---

[screen 6]

## Detection Limits: What Doesn't Work

Be honest about what detection can't do:

**No detection is definitive.**
All tools have false positive and false negative rates. "90% confidence" means 10% wrong.

**The arms race is real.**
Detection improves; generation improves faster. Current artifacts may be absent in future fakes.

**Human judgment is unreliable.**
People overestimate their ability to spot fakes. Experts do only marginally better than laypeople on visual inspection alone.

**Absence of evidence isn't evidence.**
"No artifacts detected" doesn't mean "definitely authentic." It means detection didn't find anything.

## The Voice Cloning Problem

Audio manipulation deserves special attention:

**Why voice is different:**
- Easier to fake convincingly than video
- Phone/audio contexts reduce quality expectations
- Less scrutiny than video in most situations
- Real-time conversion increasingly possible

**Real threat scenarios:**
- Impersonation calls for fraud
- Fake audio "evidence" in disputes
- Manipulated recordings presented as authentic
- Voice verification systems compromised

**Assessment approach:**
- Context matters more than detection
- Who recorded? Where? Why?
- Can the conversation be corroborated?
- Does it align with known facts?

---

[screen 8]

## The Liar's Dividend

When deepfakes become possible, authentic content becomes deniable.

**The dynamic:**
- Real footage exists of embarrassing/incriminating behavior
- Subject claims "it's a deepfake"
- Without definitive verification, doubt persists
- Authentic evidence loses impact

**This already happens:**
- Politicians dismissing real recordings as fake
- "That video is manipulated" as reflexive defense
- Audiences pre-disposed to believe denials

**Key insight:**
Deepfake capability creates damage even when no deepfake is used. The possibility enables denial of reality.

[screen 9]

## Practical Scenario

**Situation:** A video appears showing a political candidate making a controversial statement. Within hours:
- Campaign claims it's a deepfake
- Opponents claim it's authentic
- Media is inquiring whether to report

**You have:** 4 hours before editorial deadline

**Your task:** Assess authenticity with confidence level and recommendation

---

[screen 10]

## Working the Scenario

**Step 1: Provenance check (30 min)**
- Where did video first appear?
- Who uploaded it?
- Is there a chain of custody?
- Any original metadata available?

**Step 2: Context verification (30 min)**
- Was candidate at claimed location/date?
- Any corroborating footage/witnesses?
- Does statement align with or contradict known positions?

**Step 3: Technical analysis (1 hour)**
- Visual inspection for obvious artifacts
- Run through available detection tools
- Check audio-visual sync
- Analyze compression and encoding

**Step 4: Assessment synthesis (1 hour)**
- Weigh evidence by strength
- Identify what's known vs. unknown
- Determine confidence level
- Write recommendation with caveats

---

## Sample Assessment

"A 23-second video shows Candidate X stating 'I would support [controversial policy].'

**Provenance:** First appeared on anonymous account, shared to platform at 14:32. No original metadata. Account created 3 days ago.

**Context:** Candidate was in the city shown on the claimed date (confirmed via public schedule). Statement contradicts 6 months of documented positions. No other footage of this appearance has surfaced.

**Technical:** No obvious deepfake artifacts on visual inspection. Single detection tool flags as 'possible manipulation' (67% confidence). Audio-visual sync appears consistent. Video compression is unusual (non-standard encoding).

**Assessment:** Authenticity uncertain. No definitive evidence of manipulation, but provenance is weak, context raises questions, and one technical indicator is anomalous.

**Confidence:** Low. Cannot confirm as authentic or fake with available evidence.

**Recommendation:** Do not report as fact. If covering, note 'unverified video' with authentication caveats. Continue investigation. Request campaign provide evidence of deepfake claim."

## Real-World Deepfake Incidents

Context helps calibration:

**Zelenskyy surrender video (2022):**
- Crude deepfake urging Ukrainian surrender
- Quickly identified and debunked
- Low quality, minimal impact
- **Lesson:** Most FIMI deepfakes have been poor quality

**CEO voice fraud (various):**
- Multiple cases of voice cloning for wire fraud
- Often successful initially
- Detected through unusual requests, not voice analysis
- **Lesson:** Audio deepfakes are the immediate commercial threat

**Political non-events:**
- Many viral claims of "deepfake" are actually authentic or simple edits
- "Deepfake" has become generic accusation
- **Lesson:** Most "deepfake" claims are wrong

---

[screen 13]

## The Quality-Impact Tradeoff

Counterintuitive finding:

**High-quality deepfakes are rare in disinformation campaigns.**

Why?
- Creating convincing deepfakes requires time and skill
- Most disinformation doesn't need them
- Simple manipulation (selective editing, false context) works fine
- Effort vs. return often doesn't justify

**When deepfakes matter:**
- Targeted fraud (worth individual investment)
- High-value targets (worth the effort)
- Specific "evidence" fabrication
- Harassment campaigns against individuals

For most information manipulation, traditional techniques suffice.

---

[screen 14]

## Non-Consensual Intimate Imagery

The most common actual use of deepfakes:

**Reality:**
- Most deepfakes (by volume) are NCII
- Primarily targets women
- Used for harassment, extortion, abuse
- Technology makes creation trivially easy

**Why this matters for FIMI:**
- Shows what's technically possible
- Demonstrates real threat to individuals
- Often overlooked in political discourse
- Detection and response lessons apply

This isn't abstract future risk. It's current, prevalent harm.

---

[screen 15]

## Response Approaches

How to respond depends on the situation:

**If deepfake suspected:**
- Investigate before claiming
- Don't amplify by over-covering
- Note uncertainty if reporting
- Preserve original for analysis

**If deepfake claimed about authentic:**
- Demand evidence for the claim
- "It's a deepfake" is an assertion requiring proof
- Context and corroboration matter
- Don't let denial stand without scrutiny

**If authenticity genuinely uncertain:**
- State uncertainty clearly
- Don't default to either position
- Continue investigation
- Avoid contributing to noise

## DIM Application

**When deepfakes are the concern:**

**Gen 3 (Prebunking):**
- Inoculate audiences that deepfakes exist
- Teach verification habits before incidents
- Set expectation that video requires verification

**Gen 4 (Platform intervention):**
- Synthetic media policies
- Labeling requirements
- Detection integration

**Gen 5 (Structural):**
- Build authentication infrastructure
- Develop provenance standards
- Create trusted verification institutions

**Gen 2 (Debunking):**
- Useful for specific fake instances
- Risk: amplification of the fake
- Most effective when fake is already widespread

---

[screen 17]

## Stop Rules

Know when to stop investigating:

**Stop when:**
- Evidence clearly points one direction (authentic or synthetic)
- You've reached your timebox
- Additional analysis unlikely to change confidence level
- Stakes don't justify continued investigation

**Document uncertainty:**
- "Could not verify authenticity with available evidence"
- "No definitive indicators of manipulation detected; authenticity not confirmed"
- "Claim of deepfake is unsubstantiated"

Saying "I don't know" with documentation is better than false certainty.

---

[screen 18]

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: "It's a deepfake" as explanation**
Don't use "deepfake" as catch-all for suspicious video. Most manipulation isn't AI-generated.

**Mistake 2: Detection tools as arbiters**
No tool is definitive. They provide input, not answers.

**Mistake 3: "The technology exists, therefore..."**
Capability ≠ deployment. Most scenarios don't involve deepfakes even though they could.

**Mistake 4: Visual intuition as evidence**
"It looks fake to me" is weak evidence. Document specific indicators.

**Mistake 5: Assuming all denials are false**
Sometimes authentic footage is wrongly called deepfake. Sometimes it actually is.

## Building Long-Term Resilience

Beyond individual assessment:

**Institutional:**
- Provenance documentation standards
- Authentication infrastructure
- Verification capacity building

**Personal:**
- Healthy skepticism as default
- Verification habits before sharing
- Tolerance for uncertainty
- Resistance to both panic and dismissal

**Societal:**
- Media literacy education
- Trust in verification institutions
- Legal frameworks for synthetic media
- Platform accountability

The deepfake challenge is partly technical, mostly social.

## Module Assessment

**Scenario:** Three pieces of content surface during an election period:

**Content A:** Audio recording of a candidate making controversial remarks. Campaign says authentic, opposition says AI-generated. No video, originally shared on encrypted platform.

**Content B:** Video of candidate at a rally saying something incendiary. Low resolution, shared as screenshot-video of someone's phone. Campaign denies event happened.

**Content C:** High-quality video interview with candidate making policy statements that contradict previous positions. Published by established media outlet.

**Task (15 minutes):**

1. For each content piece, list the strongest signal type available
2. Which would you prioritize for investigation and why?
3. For Content A (audio), what specific verification steps would you take?
4. What would you NOT claim about any of these without additional evidence?

**Scoring:**
- Credit distinguishing signal strength across media types
- Reward appropriate prioritization
- Penalize treating all as equal threat
- Credit acknowledging audio vs. video detection differences
