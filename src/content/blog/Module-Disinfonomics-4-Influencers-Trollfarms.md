# Module: Influencers vs. Troll Farms

**Purpose**: Separate "identity merchants" from "throughput shops" and pick interventions that don't boost them.

**Output format**: Assessment → Confidence (low/med/high) → Next action

---

## Two Business Models

Both influencers and troll farms spread problematic content. But they run different businesses:

**Influencers sell identity.**
They offer belonging, certainty, enemies, community. Information is packaging.

**Troll farms sell volume.**
They offer high-output posting, templated replies, coordinated swarms. Loyalty is optional.

Understanding the difference determines intervention.

## Influencers Sell Identity

What an influencer actually offers:

- **Belonging**: "You're part of our community"
- **Certainty**: "I'll tell you what's really happening"
- **Enemies**: "They are the problem; we are the solution"
- **Status**: "You're in the know; others aren't"

The content — whether true or false — is secondary. The product is the relationship and worldview.

This is why fact-checking often fails: you're addressing the packaging, not the product.

## Troll Farms Sell Volume

What a troll farm operation offers (to its clients):

- **Throughput**: High-volume posting across many accounts
- **Swarm effects**: Coordinated amplification and harassment
- **Deniability**: Distributed attacks, no single source
- **Flexibility**: Will promote whatever the contract specifies

There's no loyalty, no community, no relationship. It's industrial output.

## Different Currencies

**Influencer economy:**
- Trust → Recurring revenue
- Credibility is the asset
- Reputation damage is costly
- Long-term relationship with audience

**Troll farm economy:**
- Throughput → Contracts/effects
- Accounts are disposable
- Reputation is irrelevant
- Short-term delivery to client

Same content might appear. The underlying business is completely different.

## Different Failure Modes

**Influencers collapse with credibility shocks.**
- Public debunking can damage standing
- Deplatforming removes income source
- Audience can turn against them
- Recovery is slow and uncertain

**Troll farms persist by rerolling.**
- Accounts banned? Create new ones.
- Network detected? Shift infrastructure.
- Narrative fails? Deploy different narrative.
- Individual exposure doesn't matter.

What kills one model barely touches the other.

## Debunking Can Be Marketing

Critical insight:

If your response increases reach, you've become their distribution partner.

**For influencers**: Public controversy often builds their brand. "Look, the establishment is attacking me" = validation.

**For troll farms**: Engagement — even negative — feeds the algorithm. Visibility is the goal.

Before responding, ask: Am I helping them win the auction?

## What to Measure

Stop measuring "truth uptake." Start measuring the business model.

**For influencers:**
- Revenue streams (donations, merch, sponsorships)
- Audience size and engagement trends
- Cross-platform presence
- Network of aligned creators

**For troll farms:**
- Account creation patterns
- Posting velocity and coordination
- Infrastructure indicators
- Persistence after disruption

Measure the operation, not the beliefs.

## Attack the Row

To intervene, break the enabling assumption in the ledger:

**Influencer ledger vulnerabilities:**
- Monetization access (demonetize)
- Platform presence (deplatform)
- Advertiser association (brand safety)
- Audience trust (credibility damage)

**Troll farm ledger vulnerabilities:**
- Cheap identity creation (verification requirements)
- Frictionless amplification (rate limits, speed bumps)
- Infrastructure access (hosting, domain registration)
- Client funding (financial tracking)

Different targets for different models.

## DIM Application

**Influencer ecosystems often need:**
- Gen 5 (community intervention) — provide alternative belonging
- Gen 3 (prebunking) — inoculate audiences before exposure
- Careful with Gen 2 — debunking can backfire as marketing

**Troll farm operations often need:**
- Gen 4 (platform moderation) — disrupt distribution infrastructure
- Infrastructure actions — target hosting, coordination mechanisms
- Less useful: belief-focused interventions (there's no sincere belief)

Match the intervention to the business model.

## Practical Scenario

**Situation**: Two accounts are spreading the same conspiracy theory about a public health measure.

**Account A**: 500K followers, personal brand, consistent voice over 3 years, sells supplements, does podcasts.

**Account B**: 2K followers, created 3 months ago, posts 80 times daily, generic profile, shares others' content.

**Task (10 minutes):**

Create two analysis cards:
- For each: Revenue model, spillover row, shared vulnerability
- Propose one non-boosting intervention for each
- Assessment + Confidence + Next action

---

[screen 11]

## Sample Response

**Account A (Influencer):**
- Revenue: Supplement affiliate, Patreon, speaking fees
- Spillover: Followers buy ineffective products; healthcare system absorbs costs
- Vulnerability: Advertiser relationships, platform monetization eligibility
- Intervention: Demonetization report to platform; do NOT public debunk (adds reach)

**Account B (Likely troll/bot):**
- Revenue: Unknown (possibly contracted, possibly ideological volunteer)
- Spillover: Adds volume to conspiracy ecosystem, gaming algorithms
- Vulnerability: Account creation cost, detection of coordinated behavior
- Intervention: Platform report for coordinated inauthentic behavior; block and document

**Assessment**: Two different operations requiring different responses. A needs economic intervention; B needs infrastructure intervention.

**Confidence**: High on Account A business model; Medium on Account B (could be enthusiastic amateur vs. organized)

**Next action**: Report both through appropriate channels; monitor A for revenue stream changes; document B network for pattern analysis.

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Treating all disinformation spreaders as troll farms**
- Most are genuine believers or commercial operators
- "It's all bots" is usually wrong

**Mistake 2: Treating all disinformation spreaders as sincere influencers**
- Some are industrial operations
- Sincere-sounding content can be manufactured

**Mistake 3: Using the same intervention for both**
- Public debunking helps influencers, wastes effort on troll farms
- Deplatforming works differently for each

**Mistake 4: Ignoring the business model**
- "They're spreading lies" doesn't tell you how to intervene
- Follow the incentives

## Hybrid Cases

Reality is messier than clean categories:

- Influencer who uses troll farm tactics for amplification
- Troll farm operator who builds personal brand
- Organic community that develops coordinated behavior
- Commercial operation that attracts genuine believers

The framework still applies: map the ledger, identify the rows, target the vulnerabilities.

If it's hybrid, you might need hybrid intervention.

## Module Assessment

**Scenario**: A network of 50 accounts is promoting a political disinformation narrative. 3 accounts have large followings (100K+) with consistent personal brands. 47 accounts are smaller, newer, post at high velocity, share each other's content.

**Task (15 minutes):**

1. Classify the two types of accounts in this network
2. Map one ledger row for each type
3. Identify the relationship (how do they work together?)
4. Propose differentiated interventions for each type
5. What's the single intervention that would most disrupt the network?
6. Assessment + Confidence + Next action

**Scoring:**
- Credit distinguishing business models
- Reward systemic thinking about network
- Penalize one-size-fits-all responses

## Key Takeaways

- Influencers sell identity (belonging, certainty, enemies, community)
- Troll farms sell volume (throughput, swarms, deniability)
- Different currencies: trust vs. contracts; credibility vs. disposability
- Different failure modes: credibility shocks vs. rerolling accounts
- Debunking can be marketing — know when you're adding distribution
- Measure the business model, not belief uptake
- Attack the row: target monetization for influencers, infrastructure for troll farms
- Match DIM generation to business model
