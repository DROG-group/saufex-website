# Module: The EU Response to FIMI


[screen 1]

The European Union faces sophisticated foreign information manipulation targeting its institutions, member states, and citizens. How is Europe responding?

The EU approach combines detection systems, platform regulation, strategic communication, and resilience building - a multi-layered defense reflecting the complex nature of FIMI threats.

[screen 2]

## The Evolution of EU Response

EU FIMI defense evolved through stages:

**2015-2017**: Initial awareness after Ukraine crisis and elections

**2018-2019**: Creation of detection systems (EUvsDisinfo, RAN)

**2020-2021**: COVID-19 infodemic accelerates platform regulation efforts

**2022-2023**: Digital Services Act and strengthened Code of Practice

**2024-2026**: Implementation and refinement of comprehensive framework

Response has moved from reactive detection to proactive resilience-building.

## EUvsDisinfo and Detection

The **East StratCom Task Force** (now part of EEAS Strategic Communication Division) created **EUvsDisinfo** in 2015.

**Function**:
- Monitoring and documenting pro-Kremlin disinformation
- Database of disinformation cases
- Weekly reports and analysis
- Public exposure of narratives and tactics

**Impact**:
- Over 15,000 documented cases
- Increased awareness among media and public
- Evidence base for policy responses

Limitations: Focus on Russian sources; reactive rather than preventive; exposure doesn't eliminate operations

[screen 4]

## The Rapid Alert System (RAS)

Launched 2019, RAS enables real-time information sharing:

**Members**: EU institutions, member states, G7 partners

**Function**:
- Early warning about foreign interference
- Coordinated detection and response
- Information sharing about campaigns
- Preparation for elections and sensitive periods

**Successes**: Coordinated responses to interference attempts during European Parliament elections and national elections

Challenge: Speed of information sharing vs verification requirements

[screen 5]

## Platform Regulation: Digital Services Act

The **Digital Services Act (DSA)**, fully implemented 2024, represents comprehensive platform regulation:

**Key provisions for FIMI defense**:
- Transparency in content moderation decisions
- Risk assessments for disinformation
- Independent audits of very large platforms
- Researcher data access
- Crisis response mechanisms
- Coordinated enforcement across member states

DSA shifts responsibility from voluntary cooperation to legal obligations.

[screen 6]

## Code of Practice on Disinformation

Strengthened in 2022, the Code of Practice on Disinformation commits platforms to:

- **Transparency**: Ad libraries, amplification algorithms disclosed
- **Integrity**: Policies against fake accounts and bot manipulation
- **Empowerment**: Tools for users to report and understand content
- **Monitoring**: Regular reports and independent evaluation
- **Research access**: Enabling independent scrutiny

Unlike earlier voluntary code, strengthened version has monitoring and accountability mechanisms.

[screen 7]

## European External Action Service (EEAS)

EEAS leads EU's diplomatic response to FIMI:

**Strategic Communication Division**:
- Coordinating messaging across EU institutions
- Supporting member states
- Monitoring foreign information manipulation
- Attribution and public exposure

**Hybrid Fusion Cell**:
- Analysis of hybrid threats including information manipulation
- Early warning and situational awareness
- Supporting member state responses

EEAS provides coordination that no single member state could achieve alone.

[screen 8]

## Election Protection

EU has developed specific election protection measures:

**European Cooperation Network on Elections** (2021):
- Information sharing during election periods
- Best practices for election security
- Coordinated platform monitoring

**Election guidance** for member states:
- Cybersecurity standards
- Disinformation monitoring
- Fact-checking support
- Media literacy campaigns

Elections remain national, but coordination strengthens resilience.

[screen 9]

## Member State Responses

Individual member states implement varied approaches:

**France**: VIGINUM (disinformation detection agency), election integrity measures

**Germany**: Federal Office for Information Security, media literacy programs

**Finland**: Comprehensive societal resilience approach, education integration

**Baltic states**: Enhanced monitoring due to proximity to Russia

**Nordic countries**: Cross-border cooperation, early warning systems

Diversity reflects different threat perceptions and political contexts.

[screen 10]

## Strategic Communication

EU's positive communication strategy:

- Promoting European values and achievements
- Countering false narratives with facts
- Engaging with target audiences directly
- Supporting independent media in neighborhood
- Multilingual outreach

Goal: Fill information space with credible content, not just debunk false claims. Proactive rather than purely reactive.

[screen 11]

## Civil Society and Research Role

EU supports independent FIMI research and monitoring:

**Funding**: Research programs, NGO support

**Access**: Platform data access for researchers (DSA requirement)

**Networks**: EDMO (European Digital Media Observatory) coordinates fact-checkers and researchers

**Collaboration**: Regular dialogue between researchers, platforms, and policymakers

Civil society provides independent monitoring that governments alone cannot.

[screen 12]

## Media Literacy Initiatives

Building societal resilience through education:

- Media literacy in school curricula (varies by member state)
- Public awareness campaigns
- Training for journalists and educators
- Toolkit development and sharing
- Research on effective interventions

Recognition: Long-term resilience requires educated, critical citizens. Technical defenses alone insufficient.

[screen 13]

## International Cooperation

EU coordinates with allies beyond Europe:

**NATO**: Hybrid threat monitoring, information sharing

**G7**: Rapid Response Mechanism for foreign interference

**Bilateral**: Cooperation with US, UK, Canada, Australia

**Multilateral**: UNESCO, OECD initiatives

FIMI operations cross borders; effective defense requires international coordination.

[screen 14]

## Legal and Diplomatic Tools

EU employs various response mechanisms:

**Sanctions**: Targeting individuals and entities involved in disinformation

**Diplomatic attribution**: Public statements naming responsible actors

**Demarches**: Formal diplomatic protests

**Restrictive measures**: Against state media outlets spreading manipulation

**Legal action**: Enforcing DSA and other regulations

These tools impose costs on actors conducting FIMI operations.

[screen 15]

## Challenges and Limitations

Despite progress, significant challenges remain:

- **Coordination**: 27 member states with different priorities
- **Speed**: Democratic processes slower than adversary adaptation
- **Resources**: Asymmetry between defense costs and attack costs
- **Legal limits**: Free speech protections constrain responses
- **Attribution**: Continued difficulty definitively identifying actors
- **Effectiveness measurement**: Unclear if defenses adequately deter operations
- **Platform cooperation**: Varies by company and region

[screen 16]

## Balancing Security and Rights

EU approach must navigate tensions:

**Content regulation** vs **free expression**

**Platform oversight** vs **innovation**

**Security** vs **privacy**

**Proactive defense** vs **reactive transparency**

Getting this balance right is essential - defeating FIMI while abandoning European values would be a form of defeat.

[screen 17]

## Future Directions

EU FIMI defense continues evolving:

- Enhanced AI detection capabilities
- Faster response mechanisms
- Improved researcher access to data
- Strengthened media literacy at scale
- Better attribution capabilities
- Increased platform accountability enforcement
- Expanded international cooperation
- Resilience metrics and assessment

The threat will persist and evolve; defense must too.

[screen 18]

## SAUFEX Project Context

The SAUFEX project exemplifies EU's research-driven approach:

**Focus**: Understanding FIMI tactics, developing detection methods, strengthening resilience

**Consortium**: Research institutions across multiple member states

**Products**: Training programs (like this course), detection tools, policy recommendations

**Approach**: Combining technical innovation with social science understanding

Projects like SAUFEX translate research into practical defense capabilities.
