# Module: AI-Powered Targeting and Personalization


[screen 1]

Two people see completely different "news" about the same event. One sees content emphasizing economic opportunity, the other sees content emphasizing cultural threat. Both believe they're seeing objective reality.

This isn't accidental. AI-powered targeting creates personalized information environments designed to manipulate each person most effectively.

## From Broadcasting to Narrowcasting

Traditional propaganda broadcasted the same message to everyone. Effective propaganda required crafting messages that resonated with broad audiences.

AI enables "narrowcasting" - sending different messages to different micro-audiences, each message optimized for that specific group's psychology and preexisting beliefs.

## Psychographic Profiling

AI doesn't just know your demographics (age, location, gender). It infers your psychology:

• Your values and moral foundations

• Your fears and anxieties

• Your personality traits

• Your emotional triggers

• Your decision-making patterns

This psychographic profile becomes a manipulation blueprint.

### Building Your Profile

AI builds psychological profiles from your digital breadcrumbs:

• What you like, share, and comment on

• How long you watch videos

• What time of day you're active

• What language you use in posts

• Who you interact with and how

• What causes emotional responses

Every click teaches AI more about manipulating you.

## Micro-Targeting at Scale

Once AI understands your psychology, it generates content specifically designed for you.

If you value family, you see content framing issues around family threat or protection. If you value fairness, the same issue is framed around injustice. The underlying message is the same, but the emotional packaging targets your specific psychological vulnerabilities.

### The Cambridge Analytica Case

Cambridge Analytica demonstrated these techniques in 2016. They collected data from millions of Facebook users, built psychographic profiles, and delivered targeted political messages designed to exploit individual psychological traits.

Introverts saw different messages than extroverts. People high in neuroticism saw content emphasizing threats. The operation was sophisticated for 2016 - today's AI makes it look primitive.

## Algorithmic Amplification

Platform algorithms don't just deliver content - they learn what keeps you engaged and show you more of it.

If disinformation triggers strong emotional responses from you, algorithms will show you more disinformation. This creates feedback loops where you're increasingly exposed to manipulative content because you react to it.

AI targeting exploits these algorithmic systems. Content designed to be engaging (often through outrage or fear) gets amplified by platform algorithms, reaching target audiences more effectively than neutral or factual content.

[screen 9]

## The Filter Bubble Effect

Over time, AI-powered personalization creates information silos. You predominantly see content confirming your existing beliefs, generated and delivered by AI systems optimizing for engagement.

You may be completely unaware that others see entirely different information landscapes. What seems like universal truth to you is actually a personalized reality.

[screen 10]

## Privacy vs Manipulation

AI targeting requires data. The more platforms know about you, the more effectively AI can personalize manipulation.

This creates tension between convenience (personalized services require data) and vulnerability (that same data enables manipulation). Privacy isn't just about confidentiality - it's a defense against targeted manipulation.

[screen 11]

## Defending Yourself

While you can't completely escape AI targeting, you can reduce vulnerability:

• Be aware when content seems designed to provoke strong emotion

• Seek out diverse information sources deliberately

• Recognize that your social media feed is algorithmically curated, not objective reality

• Question why specific content appears in your feed

• Limit data exposure through privacy settings

Awareness of personalization is your first line of defense.
