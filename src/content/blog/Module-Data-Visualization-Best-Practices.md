# Module: Data Visualization Best Practices


[screen 1]

Two charts show identical data. One makes the trend look dramatic and alarming. The other shows the same information accurately and clearly.

The difference? Design choices that either inform or manipulate. Understanding visualization principles helps you evaluate charts critically and create honest ones.

## Purpose of Data Visualization

Good visualizations serve clear purposes:

- Reveal patterns and trends not visible in raw numbers
- Enable comparison across categories or time
- Communicate findings efficiently
- Make complex data accessible
- Support accurate interpretation

Bad visualizations obscure truth through design choices that mislead, whether intentionally or through incompetence.

## Key Principles of Effective Visualization

**Accuracy**: Visual representation must match the data

**Clarity**: Main message should be immediately apparent

**Efficiency**: Maximize information relative to visual complexity

**Accessibility**: Understandable to intended audience

**Honesty**: Design choices shouldn't manipulate interpretation

Every design choice should serve these principles, not designer preferences or desired narratives.

## Choosing the Right Chart Type

Different charts serve different purposes:

**Line charts**: Trends over time (continuous data)

**Bar charts**: Comparing categories or discrete time periods

**Scatter plots**: Relationships between two variables

**Pie charts**: Parts of a whole (use sparingly - hard to compare angles)

**Histograms**: Distribution of values

Using the wrong chart type obscures rather than reveals patterns.

## The Zero Baseline Rule

One of the most common manipulation tactics: truncating the y-axis to exaggerate differences.

If a bar chart or line chart shows quantities, the axis should start at zero. Otherwise, small differences appear dramatic.

Exception: When showing change in already large numbers where the magnitude of change matters more than absolute values. But this should be clearly indicated.

## Aspect Ratio and Scale

The dimensions of a chart affect perception of trends:

A tall, narrow chart makes changes look steeper.

A wide, short chart makes changes look gradual.

Both show the same data, but create different impressions.

Quality visualization chooses aspect ratios that honestly represent the data's story, not to exaggerate or minimize.

## Color Use and Accessibility

Color should enhance understanding, not confuse:

**Use color purposefully**: Highlight important data, distinguish categories

**Ensure contrast**: Color-blind accessible combinations

**Be consistent**: Same colors mean same things throughout

**Avoid rainbow scales**: Sequential data needs sequential colors (light to dark)

**Don't rely solely on color**: Also use patterns, labels, or shapes

Poor color choices make visualizations inaccessible or misleading.

## Chart Junk and Clutter

"Chart junk" refers to visual elements that don't represent data:

- Unnecessary 3D effects
- Decorative images that distort
- Excessive gridlines
- Redundant labels
- Non-functional textures and patterns

Edward Tufte's principle: Maximize the data-ink ratio. Every visual element should represent data or aid interpretation. Remove everything else.

## Common Visualization Deceptions

**Dual axes**: Two different scales on one chart, creating false correlations

**Cherry-picked timeframes**: Selecting start/end dates to show desired trend

**Inappropriate aggregation**: Hiding important variation by aggregating

**Misleading categories**: Grouping data to support narrative

**Area distortion**: Making bubbles or images larger in two dimensions when data only increases in one

**Missing context**: Omitting baselines, comparisons, or relevant reference points

## Evaluating Visualization Integrity

Before trusting a visualization:

1. Check axes - do they start at zero? Are scales linear?

2. Look for data source citation

3. Check timeframe - cherry-picked dates?

4. Verify appropriate chart type for data

5. Look for missing context (baselines, comparisons)

6. Check if 3D or area distortions mislead

7. Consider who created it and why

8. Try to access underlying data

## Interactive Visualizations

Digital media enables interactive visualizations:

- Filtering and selection
- Zooming and detail on demand
- Animated transitions showing change
- Multiple views of same data
- User-driven exploration

Done well, interactivity enhances understanding. Done poorly, it overwhelms or enables cherry-picking desired perspectives.

## Creating Honest Visualizations

If you create visualizations:

- Start axes at zero for quantities
- Use appropriate chart types
- Provide clear titles and labels
- Cite data sources
- Show uncertainty (error bars, confidence intervals)
- Avoid unnecessary decoration
- Test with intended audience
- Make accessible to color-blind users
- Provide data tables as alternative
- Question if design choices serve clarity or narrative

## Tools and Resources

Creating quality visualizations doesn't require expensive software:

**Free tools:**
- Datawrapper (journalist-friendly)
- RAWGraphs (open source)
- Flourish (templates)
- Google Charts

**Learning resources:**
- "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information" (Edward Tufte)
- Data visualization courses (Coursera, Khan Academy)
- "How to Lie with Statistics" (Darrell Huff)

The principles matter more than the tools.

## Visualization Literacy as Citizenship

Data visualizations increasingly shape public understanding of important issues:

- COVID-19 pandemic tracking
- Climate change trends
- Economic indicators
- Election forecasting
- Public health statistics

Being able to evaluate visualization integrity is essential citizenship. Bad visualizations spread quickly on social media, shaping opinions through manipulation rather than information.

Demanding honest, clear visualizations - and creating them yourself when needed - strengthens public discourse.
