The first Polish Resilience Council is based on the following legal foundation:

**ORDER NO. 30 OF THE MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS**  
**of 24 April 2024**  
**on the establishment of the Disinformation Analysis Centre within the Foreign Service**

Acting under Article 21(1)(1) of the Act of 21 November 2008 on the Foreign Service (Journal of Laws 2024, item 973), I hereby order as follows:

**Paragraph 1.**  
Within the structure of the Foreign Service, a Disinformation Analysis Centre shall be established, hereinafter referred to as the "DAC".

**Paragraph 2.**  
The DAC operates within the Public and Cultural Diplomacy Department and reports directly to the Director of that Department.

**Paragraph 3.**  
The DAC's responsibilities include in particular:

1. Monitoring the information space in order to identify and assess disinformation campaigns.  
2. Preparing analytical reports and assessments on disinformation activities.  
3. Developing methodologies for identifying and countering disinformation.  
4. Supporting the activities of organizational units of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the field of counteracting disinformation.  
5. Providing training for the organizational units of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the field of counteracting disinformation.  
6. Developing and maintaining open source intelligence capabilities for the needs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

**Paragraph 4.**  
This Order enters into force on the day of its signing.

## Notes

- The Disinformation Analysis Centre (DAC) is the first Polish Resilience Council, although it is not called a Resilience Council yet (see also blog post ninety-one).  
- However, this RCA is located in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, while in the previous blog post ninety-one I argue that the new Polish Council should be under the prime minister.  
- The original text uses the Polish term OSINT, which is translated as "open source intelligence".
