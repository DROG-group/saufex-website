**Purpose**: Stop calling platforms "public squares." They're auction systems for visibility.

**Output format**: Assessment → Confidence (low/med/high) → Next action

## Auction, Not Newsroom

Feeds allocate visibility. Visibility is scarce. Scarcity creates an auction, explicit or not.

When you open a social media app, you're not entering a town square where everyone has equal voice. You're entering an auction house where visibility goes to the highest bidder — sometimes in money, sometimes in engagement, sometimes in platform alignment.

Understanding this changes how you think about information spread.

## The Fuel Problem

Outrage is cheap to produce and expensive to ignore.

In engagement-driven auctions, content that triggers strong emotion performs better. Not because platforms are evil, but because that's what the incentive structure rewards.

Outrage, fear, moral indignation, schadenfreude — these are high-octane fuels in the attention economy. Nuance, complexity, and uncertainty are low-grade.

The auction favors the inflammatory. This is structural, not conspiratorial.

## What's Being Auctioned

Not "speech." Visibility.

**The commodities:**
- Recommendation slots (algorithmic promotion)
- Trending space (concentrated attention)
- Search rank (discovery positioning)
- "For You" placement (personalized visibility)
- Ad adjacency (brand association)

These are scarce resources allocated by platform decision. The rules of allocation determine what spreads.

## Who Bids

Multiple actors compete in this auction:

**Creators bid with content**
- High-engagement posts win more visibility
- Gaming the algorithm is rational behavior
- Outrage works, so outrage proliferates

**Advertisers bid with money**
- Direct payment for placement
- Programmatic systems often content-blind
- Money can override organic signals

**Platforms bid with product goals**
- Editorial choices baked into algorithms
- "Integrity interventions" as visibility allocation
- Decisions about what to demote or remove

Everyone is bidding. The rules favor some bids over others.

## Externalities: The Hidden Bill

The auction produces spillovers that bidders don't pay for:

**Polarization**: Extreme content fragments shared reality
**Harassment**: Engagement-driven visibility enables pile-ons
**Institutional distrust**: Constant controversy erodes confidence
**Moderation burnout**: Human reviewers absorb psychological costs

These are real costs. They're paid by others. They're not priced into the auction.

This is why pure market solutions fail: the market doesn't include the people who pay the costs.

## Industrial Reach Principle

Here's the key distinction:

**Speech is cheap.** Anyone can say anything. This has always been true.

**Scaled distribution is industrial.** Reaching millions requires infrastructure. This is different.

Industrial things can be:
- Licensed (who can operate at scale)
- Throttled (speed limits on distribution)
- Escrowed (delayed distribution pending review)
- Taxed (costs imposed for externalities)

You can defend speech absolutely while regulating industrial distribution. These are different things.

## Friction Beats Lectures

Small costs at high scale change behavior faster than education ever could.

**Examples:**
- "Are you sure you want to share this?" prompts reduce resharing by 10-20%
- Speed bumps before posting reduce low-quality content
- Friction on monetization reduces commercial disinformation

This isn't about preventing speech. It's about making the auction less frictionless for harmful content.

Friction is a regulatory tool, not censorship.

## Monetization Is Steering

If you can't stop spread, change what pays.

**Leverage points:**
- Ad revenue adjacency (don't pay for controversial content)
- Creator fund eligibility (quality requirements)
- Recommendation inclusion (standards for algorithmic boost)
- Partnership programs (demonetization as sanction)

Most commercial disinformation follows the money. Redirect the money, redirect the content.

## DIM Application

When reach is the engine of harm:

**Gen 4 (Moderation) + selective Gen 3 (Prebunking)**

- Reduce distribution through platform mechanisms
- Don't just debunk — understand that debunking often adds distribution
- Prebunk when you can predict the narrative

Gen 2 (Debunking) heroics often add free distribution to what you're trying to counter. Be careful what you amplify.

## Practical Scenario

**Situation**: A health misinformation video is gaining traction. Current stats: 50,000 views, 2,000 shares, climbing. Content makes false claims about a vaccine, but is well-produced and emotionally compelling.

**Your analysis task (20 minutes):**

1. Define the auctioned commodity (what visibility mechanism is driving spread)
2. Identify 2 externalities (who pays costs not reflected in the auction)
3. Propose 2 incentive levers (what could change the auction dynamics)
4. Assessment + Confidence + Next action

---

[screen 11]

## Sample Response

**Auctioned commodity**: Recommendation algorithm placement. Video is being served to users with health anxiety based on engagement signals.

**Externalities**:
1. Public health system: will treat preventable illness from vaccine hesitancy
2. Platform trust teams: absorbing psychological cost of reviewing harmful health content

**Incentive levers**:
1. Demonetization: Remove ad revenue from health misinformation content
2. Recommendation exclusion: Allow content to exist but exclude from algorithmic promotion

**Assessment**: Commercial-grade health misinformation exploiting recommendation system. High confidence on distribution mechanism, medium confidence on creator intent.

**Next action**: Platform report for medical misinformation policy; do not counter-message directly (would add distribution); document for potential health authority briefing.

## The Public Square Myth

"But platforms are the new public square!"

This framing serves platform interests. It implies:
- Regulation = censorship
- All visibility is speech
- Market outcomes are democratic

Reality:
- Platforms are businesses optimizing metrics
- Visibility is allocated by algorithm and ad spend
- Outcomes reflect platform choices, not neutral markets

You can critique regulation without accepting the public square framing. These are industrial distribution systems, not town squares.

## What Platforms Actually Decide

Platforms make editorial choices constantly:

- What gets recommended vs. not
- What gets monetized vs. demonetized
- What gets labeled vs. unlabeled
- What gets removed vs. stays up
- What gets slowed vs. amplified

These are editorial decisions with massive consequences. "We're just a platform" is marketing, not description.

Understanding this is essential for effective intervention.

## Module Assessment

**Scenario**: A coordinated campaign is using a platform's trending feature to amplify a false narrative about election fraud. The content is technically within platform rules (opinion, not verifiable false claims). It's gaining visibility through high engagement.

**Task (15 minutes):**

1. What's being auctioned in this scenario?
2. Who's bidding and with what?
3. What externalities are being generated?
4. Propose 2 interventions that don't involve content removal
5. Assessment + Confidence + Next action

**Scoring:**
- Credit industrial reach framing
- Reward non-removal interventions
- Penalize "ban it all" responses without mechanism analysis

## Key Takeaways

- Platforms are auction systems for visibility, not public squares
- Outrage performs well because auctions reward engagement
- What's auctioned: recommendation slots, trending space, search rank, personalized placement
- Externalities (polarization, harassment, burnout) aren't priced into the auction
- Speech is cheap; scaled distribution is industrial — these can be regulated differently
- Friction beats lectures; small costs at scale change behavior
- Monetization is steering; redirect the money, redirect the content
- Gen 4 + selective Gen 3 when reach is the harm channel
