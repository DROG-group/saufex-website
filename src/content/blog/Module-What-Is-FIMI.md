In 2016, foreign actors interfered in multiple democratic elections through coordinated information manipulation. In 2020, they amplified pandemic conspiracies and health misinformation. In 2022, they justified military aggression through systematic falsification.

This isn't random disinformation - it's Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI), a deliberate threat to democratic societies.

[screen 2]

## Defining FIMI

**Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI)** is a pattern of behavior by foreign actors that involves:

- Coordinated and deliberate information manipulation
- Intent to interfere with target society's democratic processes, values, or interests
- Deceptive or coercive methods
- Foreign origin or coordination

Key distinction: FIMI isn't just false information from abroad - it's organized interference through information operations.

[screen 3]

## FIMI vs. Disinformation

While related, FIMI is more specific than general disinformation:

**Disinformation**: False information spread deliberately (can be domestic or foreign)

**FIMI**: Foreign-origin information operations specifically designed to interfere with democratic societies

FIMI may include true information manipulated through context, timing, or amplification. It's about the intent and coordination, not just falsity.

[screen 4]

## The FIMI Threat Landscape

FIMI operations threaten multiple dimensions of democracy:

**Political**: Interfering with elections and political processes

**Social**: Sowing division along existing fault lines

**Economic**: Undermining confidence in markets and institutions

**Security**: Creating confusion during crises

**Public health**: Amplifying dangerous health misinformation

**Cultural**: Attacking shared values and norms

FIMI exploits democratic openness to undermine democracy itself.

## Historical Context

Information manipulation by states isn't new - Cold War propaganda, "active measures," and psychological operations have long histories.

What's changed:

- **Digital platforms**: Unprecedented reach and targeting capability
- **Reduced friction**: Lower cost and risk of information operations
- **Speed**: Real-time amplification and adaptation
- **Attribution challenges**: Digital anonymity enables plausible deniability
- **Democratic vulnerabilities**: Free speech protections exploited

Modern FIMI is traditional information warfare adapted to the digital age.

[screen 6]

## The FIMI Ecosystem

FIMI operations involve multiple actors and channels:

**State actors**: Intelligence services, military units, diplomatic missions

**State-adjacent**: Media outlets, think tanks, cultural organizations

**Commercial**: PR firms, troll farms, data analytics companies

**Proxy networks**: Local activists, political parties, civil society groups

**Technical infrastructure**: Bot networks, fake accounts, amplification services

**Platforms**: Social media, messaging apps, traditional media

This ecosystem enables sophisticated, multi-layered operations.

[screen 7]

## FIMI Objectives

Foreign actors pursue various objectives through information manipulation:

- Undermine trust in democratic institutions
- Polarize societies and amplify division
- Influence election outcomes
- Justify geopolitical actions
- Undermine adversary alliances (e.g., NATO, EU)
- Promote favorable narratives
- Discredit critics and dissidents
- Normalize authoritarian governance models

Objectives vary by actor and context, but consistently target democratic resilience.

[screen 8]

## Scale and Sophistication

FIMI operations range from crude to highly sophisticated:

**Low sophistication**: Obvious fake accounts, poor language, simple messaging

**Medium**: Coordinated authentic accounts, targeted messaging, some local adaptation

**High**: Long-term cultivation of authentic-seeming personas, sophisticated targeting, multi-platform coordination, integration with offline activities

Russia, China, and Iran have demonstrated high-sophistication capabilities. Many smaller actors employ cruder methods.

[screen 9]

## Why FIMI Works

Several factors enable FIMI success:

- **Cognitive vulnerabilities**: Confirmation bias, emotional reasoning
- **Platform dynamics**: Algorithms amplify engaging content regardless of veracity
- **Information overload**: Difficulty distinguishing reliable from unreliable sources
- **Polarization**: Existing divisions are easy to exploit
- **Trust decline**: Institutional trust erosion creates information vacuum
- **Limited awareness**: Many citizens don't recognize information manipulation

FIMI exploits existing vulnerabilities rather than creating new ones.

[screen 10]

## The Democratic Dilemma

Defending against FIMI while preserving democratic values is challenging:

Free speech protections limit government intervention in information space.

Privacy rights constrain surveillance of foreign influence.

Pluralism means diverse, sometimes contradictory, information is normal.

Open societies enable foreign actors to operate more easily than in closed societies.

The challenge is building resilience without abandoning the openness that defines democracy.

[screen 11]

## FIMI in the European Context

The European Union faces particular FIMI challenges:

- 27 member states with diverse languages and political contexts
- Open information space and strong free speech protections
- Proximity to adversarial states (Russia)
- Complex historical relationships affecting narratives
- Integration challenges exploited by adversaries
- Democratic institutions under stress in some member states

EU responses include detection networks, diplomatic attribution, and platform regulation.

[screen 12]

## Who Conducts FIMI?

While many states engage in information operations, certain actors are particularly active:

**Russia**: Most prolific, sophisticated operations targeting Europe and North America

**China**: Growing capabilities, primarily defending regime and advancing geopolitical interests

**Iran**: Active in Middle East and diaspora communities

**Others**: North Korea, various non-state actors

Attribution is complex and covered in detail in a later module.

## Understanding FIMI as a System

FIMI isn't isolated events but interconnected systems:

- Long-term cultivation of assets and networks
- Coordination across platforms and countries
- Integration of cyber operations with information campaigns
- Adaptation to platform changes and countermeasures
- Persistence despite exposure and takedowns

Effective defense requires understanding FIMI systematically, not as discrete incidents.

[screen 14]

## Your Role in FIMI Defense

As a citizen, you contribute to societal resilience by:

- Understanding that FIMI exists and is actively targeting your society
- Developing critical evaluation skills for information
- Not amplifying suspicious or divisive content
- Supporting journalism and fact-checking
- Recognizing attempts to exploit divisions
- Participating in democratic processes despite attempts to discourage you

FIMI succeeds when citizens are unaware or passive. Awareness and critical engagement are fundamental defenses.
