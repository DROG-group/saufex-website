# Module: State vs Non-State Actors in FIMI


[screen 1]

A network of accounts spreads divisive content. Are they state intelligence operatives? Commercial troll farms? Ideological activists? The lines are increasingly blurred.

Understanding who conducts information manipulation - and the relationships between actors - is essential for effective defense and attribution.

[screen 2]

## State Actors

Foreign governments conduct information operations through multiple organs:

**Intelligence services**: Covert operations, cultivating assets

**Military units**: Specialized information warfare divisions

**Diplomatic missions**: Amplifying narratives, engaging local media

**State media**: RT, Xinhua, Press TV - overt propaganda with sophisticated presentation

**Think tanks and cultural institutes**: Soft power and narrative shaping

States have resources, coordination, and strategic objectives that distinguish them from other actors.

## State Capabilities and Resources

Governments bring significant advantages to information operations:

• **Funding**: Sustained operations over years or decades

• **Coordination**: Integration across agencies and countries

• **Intelligence**: Information gathering to inform targeting

• **Technical**: Cyber capabilities, AI, data analytics

• **Diplomatic**: Ability to pressure platforms and media

• **Legitimacy**: Official status lends credibility to messaging

These resources enable sophisticated, persistent campaigns impossible for most non-state actors.

## The Russian Model

Russia has demonstrated the most sophisticated and prolific FIMI operations:

**Internet Research Agency (IRA)**: Troll farm creating fake personas and content

**GRU**: Military intelligence conducting cyber and information operations

**FSB**: Domestic security service with foreign operations capability

**RT and Sputnik**: State media outlets in multiple languages

**Think tanks and foundations**: Cultivating relationships and influence

**Coordination**: Integrated campaigns across these actors

Russia's approach combines volume, persistence, and adaptation.

## The Chinese Approach

China's information operations reflect different priorities and methods:

**Focus**: Defending regime, advancing geopolitical interests, promoting Chinese model

**Methods**: Volume over sophistication, using vast networks of inauthentic accounts

**Targets**: Diaspora communities, countries with economic ties, international institutions

**Narrative**: Economic development, stability, and criticizing Western democracy

**Adaptation**: Increasingly sophisticated as capabilities grow

China's operations are less focused on disruption than Russia's, more on promotion and defense.

## State-Adjacent Actors

Many FIMI operations use entities with plausible independence from states:

**State-funded media**: Nominally independent but following state narratives

**Government-linked NGOs**: Civil society organizations with state ties

**Business entities**: Companies with state ownership or pressure

**Academic institutions**: Think tanks with state funding

**Cultural organizations**: Promoting language and culture with political messaging

This structure enables plausible deniability while advancing state objectives.

[screen 7]

## Commercial Actors

For-profit companies offer information manipulation services:

**Troll farms**: Creating content and fake engagement for hire

**PR and marketing firms**: "Reputation management" including inauthentic activity

**Data analytics companies**: Targeting and psychological profiling

**Bot operators**: Selling amplification and fake followers

**Ad tech**: Programmatic advertising for propaganda

Some work for states, others for commercial clients, many for both. Financial motivation distinguishes them from ideological actors.

[screen 8]

## Non-State Ideological Actors

Not all information manipulation comes from states:

**Extremist groups**: Far-right, far-left, religious extremists

**Single-issue activists**: Anti-vaccination, conspiracy theorists

**Geopolitical movements**: Pan-nationalist or pan-religious movements

**Local political actors**: Domestic groups using foreign tactics

These actors may operate independently or align with state interests opportunistically. Motivations are ideological rather than geopolitical or financial.

[screen 9]

## Proxy Relationships

States increasingly operate through proxies to enable deniability:

**Direct proxies**: Entities directly controlled but officially independent

**Indirect proxies**: Funded or influenced but with some autonomy

**Useful idiots**: Unaware they're advancing foreign interests

**Opportunistic alignment**: Independent actors whose goals temporarily align with state interests

Attribution becomes difficult when genuine activists unwittingly amplify state-sponsored narratives.

[screen 10]

## The Blurred Boundary

Distinguishing state from non-state actors is increasingly difficult:

• Commercial actors work for states

• States cultivate and fund "grassroots" movements

• Ideological actors coordinate with states when interests align

• States use platforms and techniques indistinguishable from commercial actors

• True believers amplify state narratives organically

This ambiguity is strategic - attribution challenges enable plausible deniability.

[screen 11]

## Motivations and Objectives

Different actor types pursue different goals:

**States**: Geopolitical advantage, undermining adversaries, defending regime

**Commercial**: Profit from providing manipulation services

**Ideological**: Advancing political or social worldview

**Criminal**: Financial fraud through misinformation

**Personal**: Individual grievances or attention-seeking

Understanding motivation helps predict behavior and design countermeasures.

[screen 12]

## Coordination and Independence

Information manipulation operations fall on a spectrum:

**Fully coordinated**: Single directing actor with controlled subsidiaries

**Loosely coordinated**: Multiple actors with informal cooperation

**Convergent**: Independent actors with aligned interests acting similarly

**Organic amplification**: State content spread by genuine users

Most sophisticated operations combine centralized coordination with organic amplification.

[screen 13]

## Domestic vs. Foreign Actors

The domestic/foreign distinction matters legally and strategically:

**Foreign actors**: FIMI, subject to foreign interference responses

**Domestic actors**: Subject to free speech protections and limited state intervention

**Domestic actors amplifying foreign content**: Complex legal and ethical questions

**Foreign-funded domestic actors**: Transparency and disclosure requirements

Democratic responses must distinguish between foreign interference and domestic discourse, even when they're hard to separate.

[screen 14]

## The Evolving Landscape

The actor landscape is evolving:

• More states developing capabilities

• Commercial market for information manipulation growing

• Techniques democratizing - easier for smaller actors

• Platforms improving detection, forcing adaptation

• International coordination improving attribution

• Legal frameworks addressing foreign influence

Understanding actors isn't static - continuous learning is required as the landscape changes.

[screen 15]

## Why Actor Attribution Matters

Identifying who is behind operations enables:

• **Appropriate responses**: Diplomatic, legal, or technical countermeasures

• **Public awareness**: Exposing operations reduces effectiveness

• **Platform action**: Removal based on coordinated inauthentic behavior

• **Legal accountability**: Sanctions, prosecutions where applicable

• **Strategic understanding**: Analyzing adversary tactics and objectives

But attribution is technically and politically challenging - covered in detail in Module 5.
