# Module: How Information Spreads Online

By **SAUFEX Consortium** | Last Updated: **23 January 2026**

Every day, billions of pieces of content compete for your attention online. But have you ever wondered why you see what you see? Why does some content "go viral" while other posts disappear?

Understanding how information spreads online is crucial to recognizing how disinformation reaches millions.

## The Algorithm Decides

When you open Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or TikTok, you're not seeing everything your friends post. Instead, an algorithm - a set of computer instructions - decides what appears in your feed.

The algorithm's job? Keep you scrolling as long as possible.

These algorithms prioritize "engagement" - likes, shares, comments, and time spent viewing. Content that triggers strong emotions (anger, fear, joy, outrage) gets more engagement.

This is why false and misleading information often spreads faster than accurate news: it's designed to provoke emotion.

## Going Viral

A post "goes viral" when it spreads exponentially - from dozens to thousands to millions of people in hours. Virality happens through a chain reaction: someone sees content, shares it, their followers share it, and so on.

But virality isn't random. It follows patterns.

Viral content typically has three characteristics:

• Strong emotional appeal (makes you laugh, angry, or shocked)

• Social currency (makes you look knowledgeable or entertaining when you share it)

• Simplicity (easy to understand and share quickly)

Disinformation creators deliberately design content with these characteristics.

## Filter Bubbles and Echo Chambers

Algorithms learn your preferences from your past behavior. If you often click on political content from one perspective, the algorithm will show you more similar content.

Over time, this creates a "filter bubble" - you mainly see information that confirms what you already believe.

Inside filter bubbles, false claims can spread unchecked. When everyone in your feed agrees with a misleading narrative, it starts to feel like truth.

Echo chambers amplify this effect: not only do you see similar views, but opposing perspectives become invisible or are actively rejected.

## Network Effects

Your position in social networks matters. Some accounts are "super-spreaders" - they have large followings or connections to multiple communities. When they share disinformation, it reaches far more people than when an average user does.

Coordinated campaigns exploit this by targeting influential users or creating fake accounts that appear influential.

## Breaking Free

Now you understand the mechanics: algorithms prioritize engagement, emotional content spreads faster, filter bubbles limit your perspective, and network position amplifies reach.

This knowledge is your first defense. When you see content designed to provoke strong emotion, pause. Ask yourself: is this spreading because it's true, or because it's designed to spread?
