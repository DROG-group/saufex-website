# Module: Debunking Best Practices

By **SAUFEX Consortium** | Last Updated: **23 January 2026**

[screen 1]

A false claim has gone viral. Millions have seen it. Some believe it. How do you correct the record without amplifying the misinformation or triggering defensive reactions?

Debunking is challenging, but research has identified practices that work better than others. Understanding evidence-based debunking is essential for anyone countering misinformation.

[screen 2]

## What Is Debunking?

Debunking corrects false information after it spreads:

**Definition**: Providing evidence and explanation that refutes a false claim

**When necessary**:
• False claim already widely circulated
• Prebunking wasn't possible or insufficient
• Belief correction needed
• Harm reduction urgent

**Challenge**: Working against cognitive biases that favor false belief persistence

**Goal**: Not just correcting facts, but replacing false belief with accurate understanding

Debunking is damage control when prevention failed.

## The Debunking Challenge

Why is correcting false beliefs so difficult?

**Continued Influence Effect**: False information continues influencing beliefs even after correction

**Backfire Effect**: Corrections sometimes strengthen false beliefs

**Familiarity Backfire**: Repeating false claim to debunk increases familiarity, potentially increasing belief

**Source Confusion**: People remember claim but forget it was debunked

**Motivated Reasoning**: Identity-protective cognition resists belief change

**Psychological**: Admitting error threatens self-image

Understanding these mechanisms guides effective debunking strategies.

[screen 4]

## The Truth Sandwich Method

Structure debunks to avoid amplifying false claims:

**Traditional approach** (problematic):
1. State false claim clearly
2. Say it's false
3. Provide true information

**Problem**: Repeats false claim, increasing familiarity

**Truth Sandwich** (better):
1. **State truth first** (fact)
2. **Warn** that misinformation exists
3. **Explain falsehood** briefly
4. **Refute** with evidence
5. **Restate truth** (fact)

**Why it works**: True information receives more attention and repetition than false claim

Lead with facts, not falsehoods.

## Fill the Gap

Debunking creates explanatory void - fill it:

**Problem**: Simply negating false explanation leaves people without alternative

**Example**:
• False: "Vaccines cause autism"
• Weak debunk: "No they don't"
• Better: "Vaccines don't cause autism. The study suggesting this was fraudulent and retracted. Multiple large studies show no link. Autism signs appear around same age as routine vaccines, creating coincidental timing but not causation."

**Principle**: Provide alternative causal explanation

**Why it works**: Human minds prefer having explanation to having none

Don't just debunk - provide replacement knowledge.

[screen 6]

## Keep It Simple

Complexity advantages misinformation:

**False claims**: Often simple, memorable

**Corrections**: Often complex, detailed

**Problem**: Asymmetry favors falsehood

**Solution**:
• Core correction in one sentence
• Supporting details available but secondary
• Visual aids to simplify
• Analogies for complex issues

**Example**:
• Weak: "Climate models incorporate multiple forcing factors..."
• Better: "97% of climate scientists agree humans cause climate change"

**Caveat**: Don't oversimplify to the point of inaccuracy

Simplicity increases effectiveness without sacrificing truth.

[screen 7]

## Source Credibility Matters

Who delivers correction affects reception:

**Trusted sources more effective**:
• Domain experts (scientists for health claims)
• Nonpartisan fact-checkers
• In-group members (shared identity)
• Previously trusted sources

**Source considerations**:
• Match source to audience
• Conservatives trust different sources than liberals
• Local voices often more trusted than distant authorities
• Peer correction sometimes most effective

**Caution**: Even trusted sources face limits with identity-central beliefs

**Strategy**: Use most credible available source for target audience

[screen 8]

## Affirmation Before Correction

Reduce defensive processing:

**Technique**: Affirm audience values before presenting correction

**Examples**:
• "I know you care about protecting children..." [before vaccine facts]
• "We all want secure elections..." [before debunking fraud claims]
• "Like you, I want to understand the truth..." [before correction]

**Why it works**: Reduces threat to identity, makes correction less defensive

**Self-affirmation**: Having people reflect on personal values before correction

**Research support**: Modest but consistent effects

Lower defenses increase receptiveness.

[screen 9]

## Avoid Partisan Framing

Make corrections less politically charged:

**Problem**: Framing correction in partisan terms triggers motivated reasoning

**Better approach**:
• Present as shared values issue
• Use nonpartisan sources
• Avoid political language
• Focus on facts, not ideology

**Example**:
• Weak: "Trump's false claim about..."
• Better: "Analysis of election data shows..."

**Limitation**: Some issues inherently partisan; complete neutrality impossible

**Goal**: Minimize unnecessary partisan triggers

[screen 10]

## Address Emotions

Misinformation often emotionally resonant:

**Problem**: Purely factual corrections miss emotional dimension

**Approach**:
• Acknowledge emotional appeal of false claim
• Provide emotionally satisfying truth
• Validate concerns while correcting facts
• Appropriate emotional tone

**Example** (vaccine hesitancy):
• Acknowledge: "I understand the fear for your child's safety"
• Validate: "Protecting children is paramount"
• Correct: "Vaccines are thoroughly tested for safety"
• Satisfy: "Vaccination protects your child from serious diseases"

**Balance**: Engage emotion without manipulation

[screen 11]

## Visual Debunking

Images increase effectiveness:

**Why visuals help**:
• Processing fluency
• Memorability
• Engagement
• Simplification of complex information

**Visual debunking approaches**:
• Infographics showing true vs false
• Side-by-side comparisons
• Annotated images pointing out manipulation
• Charts and graphs for data

**Caution**: Poor visuals can confuse or bore

**Best practice**: Professional design, clear message, minimal text

Visual debunking reaches broader audiences.

[screen 12]

## Prebunk Within Debunk

Even when debunking, use inoculation:

**Technique**: Explain manipulation technique while correcting specific claim

**Example**:
• "This image uses emotional manipulation - showing suffering to bypass critical thinking. Here's what actually happened..."

**Value**: Teaches technique recognition, builds future resistance

**Efficiency**: Addresses specific claim while building general resilience

Transform reactive debunking into proactive inoculation.

[screen 13]

## Avoid These Debunking Mistakes

Common errors that undermine effectiveness:

**Leading with false claim**: Don't headline misinformation

**Repeating false claim unnecessarily**: Increases familiarity

**Condescension**: "How could anyone believe..." alienates

**Excessive detail**: Overwhelming complexity loses audience

**Lacking alternative explanation**: Leaving causal void

**Ignoring emotional dimensions**: Treating as purely factual matter

**Wrong messenger**: Source credibility mismatch

**Defensive triggering**: Partisan framing, identity threats

**No visual support**: Missing engagement opportunity

Avoiding mistakes as important as applying best practices.

[screen 14]

## Timing Considerations

When to debunk affects effectiveness:

**Immediate debunking** (within hours):
• Prevents belief crystallization
• Reaches people before deep exposure
• Can prevent viral spread

**Delayed debunking** (days/weeks later):
• Beliefs more entrenched
• Wider audience already exposed
• Backfire risks higher
• But: Still valuable

**Continuous correction**: Persistent false narratives require sustained response

**Strategic silence**: Sometimes not responding denies attention

**Balance**: Speed vs quality of correction

Earlier usually better, but quality matters.

[screen 15]

## Platform-Specific Strategies

Different platforms require different approaches:

**Twitter/X**:
• Concise corrections
• Thread format for detail
• Quote-tweet carefully (can amplify)
• Direct replies vs public debunks

**Facebook**:
• Fact-checker labels
• Group corrections for community norms
• Personal relationships enable peer correction

**YouTube**:
• Video debunks for video claims
• Community notes
• Collaborative debunking channels

**TikTok**:
• Short, engaging format
• Stitch/duet features for direct response
• Visual creativity matters

Meet audiences on their platforms with appropriate formats.

[screen 16]

## Debunking in Personal Networks

Correcting friends and family:

**Unique challenges**:
• Relationship preservation matters
• Identity threats heightened
• More receptiveness (existing trust)
• Ongoing interactions, not one-time

**Best practices**:
• Private message > public correction
• Questions > assertions ("Where did you see that?")
• Empathy and respect
• Shared values emphasis
• Patience - not expecting immediate change
• Preserving relationship > winning argument

**When to disengage**: If correction harms relationship disproportionately

Personal debunking requires extra care.

[screen 17]

## Measuring Debunking Success

How to know if debunking worked:

**Individual level**:
• Belief change (immediate, delayed)
• Sharing behavior change
• Openness to future corrections

**Network level**:
• Reduced false content sharing
• Decreased engagement with false content
• Increased accurate information sharing

**Societal level**:
• Polling on belief prevalence
• Information quality metrics
• Misinformation impact reduction

**Reality**: Perfect measurement difficult; improvement over baseline shows value

Track what you can; don't let perfect be enemy of good.

[screen 18]

## When Debunking Isn't Enough

Recognize debunking limitations:

**When debunking fails**:
• Identity-central beliefs
• Extreme motivated reasoning
• Closed information ecosystems
• Cult-like group dynamics

**Alternatives to debunking**:
• Prebunking for prevention
• Structural interventions (platform design)
• Reducing exposure to false sources
• Building media literacy
• Addressing underlying conditions (anxiety, distrust)

**Acceptance**: Not every false belief correctable

**Focus**: Persuadable audiences, correctable beliefs

Debunking is one tool, not the only tool.
