# Module: Hybrid Threats - Definition and Examples


[screen 1]

In 2014, "little green men" - soldiers without insignia - appeared in Crimea. Russia denied involvement while simultaneously waging information campaigns, cyber attacks, and economic pressure. Crimea was annexed without traditional warfare.

This is hybrid warfare: blending military and non-military, conventional and unconventional, overt and covert tactics to achieve strategic objectives while maintaining plausible deniability.

## Defining Hybrid Threats

Hybrid threats combine:

- Military force (conventional and unconventional)
- Information operations and propaganda
- Cyber attacks
- Economic coercion
- Political subversion
- Legal warfare (exploiting laws and regulations)

The combination makes attribution difficult and responses complicated, operating in a "gray zone" below traditional warfare thresholds.

### Why "Hybrid"?

Traditional warfare had clear boundaries: declared wars, uniformed soldiers, identifiable battlefields. Peace and war were distinct states.

Hybrid threats blur these boundaries. Is a cyber attack on infrastructure an act of war? Is funding opposition groups invasion? Is disinformation campaign aggression?

This ambiguity is strategic - it complicates victim response and divides international coalitions.

## Key Characteristics

**Multi-domain**: Operating across military, informational, economic, and political spheres simultaneously

**Deniability**: Using proxies, unmarked forces, or cyber attacks that can't be definitively attributed

**Ambiguity**: Staying below thresholds that would trigger clear response (like NATO Article 5)

**Adaptability**: Quickly shifting tactics based on victim responses

**Long-term**: Campaigns lasting years rather than days or weeks

## Information as a Weapon Domain

In hybrid warfare, information operations serve multiple purposes:

- **Preparation**: Shaping opinions before military action
- **Cover**: Providing alternative narratives during operations
- **Division**: Splitting victim societies and international alliances
- **Demoralization**: Undermining will to resist
- **Justification**: Creating pretexts for escalation

Information warfare isn't auxiliary - it's central to hybrid strategy.

## Case Study: Russian Hybrid Operations

**Estonia 2007**: Cyber attacks on government and banking infrastructure, coinciding with political dispute over Soviet-era monument

**Georgia 2008**: Military invasion combined with cyber attacks, disinformation about Georgian "genocide," and economic pressure

**Ukraine 2014-present**: Unmarked forces, separatist proxies, cyber sabotage, continuous disinformation, economic warfare

Each operation refined hybrid tactics based on previous lessons.

## Case Study: COVID-19 Information Operations

Multiple state actors used the pandemic for hybrid operations:

- **China**: Promoting conspiracy theories about US origins of virus
- **Russia**: Amplifying vaccine hesitancy in Western countries while promoting own vaccines
- **Iran**: Spreading disinformation about Western pandemic responses

These campaigns exploited crisis to advance strategic objectives while maintaining deniability.

## Case Study: Election Interference

Modern hybrid threats increasingly target democratic processes:

**Russian operations 2016**: Social media manipulation, hacking and leaking emails, targeted disinformation, exploitation of existing divisions

**Chinese operations**: Economic pressure on diaspora communities, infiltration of community organizations, control of Chinese-language media abroad

**Iranian operations**: Social media campaigns, hack-and-leak operations against adversaries

[screen 9]

## The Gray Zone Challenge

Hybrid threats operate in gray zones where:

- Attribution is difficult but not impossible
- Actions are harmful but don't clearly justify military response
- International law application is ambiguous
- Response options are limited or risky
- Victim societies are divided on how to respond

Adversaries exploit this space, achieving objectives while avoiding consequences.

## Why Hybrid Threats Succeed

Hybrid approaches exploit several asymmetries:

- **Speed**: Victims need time to attribute, build consensus, formulate response
- **Ambiguity**: Unclear whether responses should be diplomatic, economic, cyber, or military
- **Divisions**: Democratic societies debate response while authoritarian adversaries act decisively
- **Risk tolerance**: Democracies are more cautious about escalation

These factors give hybrid operators advantages despite weaker overall power.

## Implications for Defense

Defending against hybrid threats requires:

- Early detection and attribution capabilities
- Resilience across multiple domains (not just military)
- Rapid decision-making despite ambiguity
- Coordinated whole-of-government responses
- International coordination and information sharing
- Public resilience against information manipulation

Defense must be as integrated and adaptive as the threats.
