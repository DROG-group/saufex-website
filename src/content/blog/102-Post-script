description: "Interdemocracy does not work as a performative obligation."

In the event, an Interdemocracy facilitator interprets their role as „formal,” all elements that make up the format of Interdemocracy become a performative obligation, a procedure that needs to be implemented for the sake of getting the implementation done. Maybe this interpretation of the role of facilitator is chosen by overly ambitious or insecure teachers.
When a teacher plays their part of facilitator formally, students start experiencing the elements that make up Interdemocracy as meaningless tasks; hardly any sense of purpose emerges. No “ma” is brought to life, just a dull emptiness. While “ma” is a form with the potential to embed content, in this case the space between students, elements, and statements is a mere empty interval between tasks, a boring non-event. The emptiness is reflected in student statements; many proclaim to have no opinion, to see no sense, or worse, they simply agree with whatever is happening to get it over with.
Yes, a facilitator needs to be procedural, and refrain from helping or offering their opinions, evaluations, or frames, this does not mean that their role is formal. The procedural character of the role does not exclude facilitator engagement, passion, enthusiasm, joy, empathy, care, and commitment. On the contrary, these elements of ethical care transform nothingness into a potential, into an invitation to be present.
