## Why Verification Tools Matter

You don't need to be a professional investigator to verify content:

- Most powerful verification tools are free and web-based
- Basic verification catches the majority of manipulation
- Tools democratize verification abilities
- Systematic tool use prevents sharing false information
- Quick verification prevents amplification of manipulation

Every informed citizen can develop basic verification skills.

## Reverse Image Search

The single most valuable verification tool:

**Google Images** (images.google.com)
- Upload image or paste URL
- Shows where else image appears online
- Best for recent, popular images

**TinEye** (tineye.com)
- Oldest, largest index
- Good for finding original sources
- Shows oldest known versions

**Yandex** (yandex.com/images)
- Excellent for Russian/Eastern European sources
- Often finds results others miss
- Good facial recognition

**Bing Visual Search**
- Microsoft's image search
- Sometimes finds unique results

## How to Use Reverse Image Search

Effective reverse image search requires technique:

**Step 1**: Save or screenshot the image

**Step 2**: Upload to multiple search engines (they index differently)

**Step 3**: Check results for:
- Original source and date
- Different contexts (same image, different claims)
- Higher resolution versions
- Edits or alterations

**Step 4**: Verify the earliest appearance you find

**Tips**:
- Try cropped portions if full image yields nothing
- Remove text overlays before searching
- Search video keyframes

[screen 5]

## Video Verification Tools

Videos are harder but still verifiable:

**InVID/WeVerify** (weverify.eu)
- Browser extension for video verification
- Extracts keyframes for reverse image search
- Metadata analysis
- Magnification and forensics tools

**YouTube DataViewer** (citizenevidence.amnesty.org)
- Extracts upload date and thumbnail
- Provides reverse image search links

**RevEye** browser extension
- Right-click reverse image search
- Works on video thumbnails

Videos require keyframe extraction, then image verification techniques apply.

## Metadata Analysis Tools

Digital files contain metadata revealing manipulation:

**EXIF data viewers**:
- Jeffrey's Image Metadata Viewer (regex.info/exif.html)
- Get-Metadata.com
- Shows camera, date, location, editing software

**What metadata reveals**:
- When photo/video was created
- Device/camera used
- GPS coordinates (if not stripped)
- Editing software used
- Modification history

**Limitations**:
- Metadata easily stripped or falsified
- Absence of metadata proves nothing
- Presence of inconsistent metadata is significant

## Geolocation Verification

Verifying claimed locations:

**Google Earth/Maps**
- Match landmarks, buildings, street features
- Historical imagery for time verification
- Street View for ground-level verification

**SunCalc** (suncalc.org)
- Verify shadow direction matches claimed time/location
- Sun position calculator

**PeakFinder** (peakfinder.org)
- Identify mountains in photos/videos
- Verify claimed locations

**Techniques**:
- Match visible landmarks
- Verify architectural details
- Check sun/shadow positions
- Confirm weather against historical data

## Deepfake Detection Tools

AI-generated content detection is evolving:

**Microsoft Video Authenticator**
- Analyzes videos for manipulation
- Provides confidence score

**Deepware Scanner** (deepware.ai)
- Online deepfake detection
- Upload video for analysis

**Sensity** (sensity.ai)
- Deepfake detection platform
- Primarily for organizations

**Manual indicators**:
- Unnatural blinking or no blinking
- Odd lighting/shadows on face
- Blurry or inconsistent face boundaries
- Audio-visual desynchronization
- Artifacts around face edges

Detection is an arms race - tools lag behind generation capabilities.

## Fact-Checking Databases

Check if claims already verified:

**ClaimReview** (Google Fact Check Explorer)
- Aggregates fact-checks from IFCN signatories
- Search by keyword or URL
- Shows multiple fact-checker verdicts

**Snopes** (snopes.com)
- Oldest fact-checking site
- Good for viral claims and urban legends

**FactCheck.org**, **PolitiFact**, **Full Fact**
- Specialized fact-checking organizations
- Country/region specific

**Google Search + "fact check"**
- Often surfaces existing fact-checks
- Quick way to see if claim already debunked

[screen 10]

## Web Archive Tools

Verify changes and capture ephemeral content:

**Internet Archive Wayback Machine** (archive.org/web)
- Historical snapshots of websites
- Verify how pages looked in past
- Capture disappearing content

**Archive.is / Archive.today**
- Create permanent snapshots
- Captures current state of pages
- Useful for preserving evidence

**Cached pages**
- Google cache (click arrow next to result)
- Bing cache
- Shows recent archived versions

**Use cases**:
- Verify website changes
- Capture evidence before deletion
- Check original headlines/content
- Verify account history

## Website Credibility Tools

Assess source reliability:

**WHOIS lookup**
- Who registered the domain?
- When was it registered?
- Where is it hosted?

**NewsGuard** (browser extension)
- Rates news websites for credibility
- Shows ownership and transparency
- Identifies misinformation sites

**MediaBiasFactCheck**
- Evaluates news source bias and reliability
- Shows factual reporting record

**Wikipedia**
- Often has articles on media outlets
- Shows ownership, history, controversies

## Screenshot Verification

Screenshots easily fabricated:

**What to check**:
- Font inconsistencies
- Timestamp plausibility
- Platform UI accuracy (changes over time)
- URL/handle accuracy
- Interaction counts matching engagement patterns

**Verification approach**:
- Search for original post (if accessible)
- Check archive versions
- Contact claimed source for confirmation
- Look for verification by others
- Treat unverifiable screenshots skeptically

Never trust a screenshot without verification.

## Building a Verification Workflow

Systematic approach beats ad-hoc verification:

**Standard workflow**:

1. Pause before sharing
2. Check source credibility
3. Reverse image/video search
4. Search fact-checking databases
5. Verify location claims if relevant
6. Check date plausibility
7. Search for confirmation from reputable sources
8. If uncertain, don't share

**Time investment**:
- Basic verification: 2-5 minutes
- Thorough verification: 10-30 minutes
- Complex investigations: Hours or more

Most verification is quick; sophisticated manipulation takes time.

## Limitations and Cautions

Verification tools aren't perfect:

- No single tool is comprehensive
- Tools can be defeated by sophisticated actors
- Some manipulation is undetectable
- Tools require skill and judgment
- Results need interpretation
- New manipulation techniques outpace detection
- Access restrictions limit some tools

**Best practice**: Use multiple tools and methods. Converging evidence increases confidence. When uncertain, express uncertainty rather than false certainty.
