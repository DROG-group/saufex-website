# Module: Recognizing Manipulation Tactics


[screen 1]

A headline screams: "They're Coming for Your Children!" Below is a story with just enough truth to seem credible, but twisted to provoke fear and outrage.

Disinformation creators use predictable tactics. Once you recognize them, you become much harder to manipulate.

[screen 2]

## Emotional Manipulation

The most powerful manipulation tactic is triggering strong emotions that bypass rational thinking.

**Fear**: "If this happens, everything you value is threatened"

**Anger**: "These people are attacking you and yours"

**Disgust**: "This group is morally repugnant"

**Tribal pride**: "We're superior, they're inferior"

When you feel intense emotion from content, pause before sharing or believing.

[screen 3]

### Why Emotions Work

Evolution wired our brains to react quickly to threats. Strong emotions trigger fast, automatic responses that helped our ancestors survive.

Manipulators exploit this. By triggering fear or anger, they can make you act before you think - sharing, clicking, donating, or voting based on emotion rather than facts.

## Logical Fallacies

Manipulators use faulty reasoning that sounds convincing but doesn't hold up to scrutiny.

**Straw Man**: Misrepresenting someone's argument to make it easier to attack

"They want to regulate guns? They want to take away all your freedom!"

This distorts the position to make it seem extreme.

[screen 5]

**False Dichotomy**: Pretending only two options exist when more are available

"Either you support this policy completely, or you're against protecting children."

Reality usually offers more nuanced positions, but manipulators force false either/or choices.

[screen 6]

**Slippery Slope**: Claiming a small step will inevitably lead to extreme outcomes

"If we allow this minor regulation, soon we'll have total government control of everything!"

While sometimes legitimate, this tactic often exaggerates without evidence of inevitable progression.

[screen 7]

**Ad Hominem**: Attacking the person rather than their argument

"Of course she says that - she's an elitist who doesn't understand real people."

This diverts attention from whether the argument is valid by focusing on the arguer's character or background.

[screen 8]

**Appeal to Emotion**: Using feelings instead of logic as evidence

"How can you not support this? Think of how the victims must feel!"

Emotions matter, but they're not logical evidence that something is true or the right course of action.

[screen 9]

## Manipulation Through Omission

Sometimes manipulation isn't about what's said, but what's left out.

**Cherry-picking**: Selecting only data that supports your conclusion while ignoring contradictory evidence

**Context removal**: Sharing a quote or statistic without the context that would change its meaning

**Selective reporting**: Covering some stories extensively while ignoring others that contradict the narrative

[screen 10]

## Exploitation of Cognitive Biases

Manipulators exploit how our minds naturally work:

**Confirmation bias**: We readily accept information that confirms existing beliefs

**Availability bias**: We judge probability by how easily examples come to mind

**Bandwagon effect**: We adopt beliefs because many others hold them

**Authority bias**: We trust figures of authority even outside their expertise

Awareness of these biases helps you resist manipulation.

## The "Just Asking Questions" Technique

Manipulators often pose as neutral truth-seekers:

"I'm just asking questions. Why won't they answer? What are they hiding?"

This plants suspicion without making falsifiable claims. When challenged, they claim innocence - "I'm just asking!"

Legitimate questions provide context and seek information. Manipulative questions presume guilt and aim to create suspicion.

## Protecting Yourself

When you encounter persuasive content, ask:

- Am I feeling strong emotion? That's a signal to slow down.
- Is this using logical fallacies I recognize?
- What information might be omitted?
- Is this exploiting my existing biases?
- Who benefits if I believe or share this?
- Can I verify this independently?

Recognition is the first step to resistance. The more you practice identifying these tactics, the more automatic it becomes.
