If the new Polish National Council for Digital Services (in Polish: Krajowa Rada Uslug Cyfrowych) sees the light of day, it is based on the following legal foundation:

**ARTICLE 15F.**

1. A Council for Digital Services is established, hereinafter referred to as "the Council", as a consultative and advisory body to the President of UKE.
2. The Council shall consist of 16 members, including:
   1. two representatives of the minister competent for informatization,
   2. two representatives of the minister competent for culture and protection of national heritage,
   3. one representative of the minister competent for economic affairs,
   4. one representative of the minister competent for consumer affairs,
   5. one representative of the minister competent for foreign affairs,
   6. one representative of the minister competent for national defense,
   7. one representative of the minister competent for internal affairs,

5. The tasks of the Council shall include, in particular:
   1. giving opinions on draft decisions of the President of UKE,
   2. giving opinions on draft national strategies and programs related to digital services,
   3. giving opinions on draft national legislation concerning digital services,
   4. providing advice to the President of UKE on issues related to digital services,
   5. providing advice to the President of UKE on issues related to the Digital Services Act, including monitoring the implementation of that Act.

## Notes

- The final section (point 5) is closely related to the tasks of the DAC (see [blog post ninety-three](/insights/93-Order-no-30-of-the-Polish-Minister-of-Foreign-Affairs)).  
- Although the National Council for Digital Services is not a Resilience Council, it can be seen as its umbrella. It should have similar approaches and responsibilities as the Resilience Council in the SAUFEX project.  
- The Polish name of the Council is: Krajowa Rada Uslug Cyfrowych (KRUC).
