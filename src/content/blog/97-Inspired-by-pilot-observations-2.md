Ongoing empirical regional piloting of program Interdemocracy indicates a systematic difference between two professional role types within the same institutional setting: teachers on the one hand, and school psychologists or pedagogists on the other. This difference proves decisive for the feasibility of democratic, autonomy-preserving deliberation.

## Intervention-first versus observation-first roles

Teachers operate within an intervention-first epistemic logic. Their professional legitimacy is tied to real-time guidance, correction, and steering of student cognition. When students struggle, teachers experience a strong obligation to intervene, clarify, or normalize responses. Non-intervention is commonly perceived as negligence or loss of pedagogical responsibility.

School psychologists and pedagogists, by contrast, operate within an observation-first epistemic logic. Their professional competence is defined by the ability to suspend judgment, allow situations to unfold, observe patterns, and only then design proportionate interventions. Premature intervention is regarded as epistemically unsound and professionally inappropriate.

This divergence is not a matter of personality or training quality, but of structurally encoded role expectations.

## Epistemic authority and naive realism

The intervention impulse characteristic of teaching roles is reinforced by naive realism (see [blog post ninety-six](/insights/96-Inspired-by-pilot-observations-1)): the tacit assumption that one’s own perceptions and interpretations reflect objective reality. Within the teaching role, this assumption leads to a misclassification of communicative modes: teacher-speaking is implicitly treated as fact-speaking, while student-speaking is treated as belief-speaking.

Psychologists and pedagogists are institutionally protected from this fusion of authority and epistemic certainty. Their role explicitly frames perceptions as provisional hypotheses rather than objective truths. As a result, they are better able to tolerate ambiguity, refrain from evaluative feedback, and preserve epistemic symmetry in group settings.

## Consequences for democratic deliberation

Deliberative formats that rely on belief-speaking, autonomy, and non-directive facilitation are structurally misaligned with the teaching role as it is currently constituted. Even when teachers act with goodwill and explicit procedural guidance, their role obligations tend to reintroduce epistemic hierarchy through subtle forms of influence, reinforcement, and correction.

Psychologists and pedagogists, by contrast, are structurally compatible with such formats. Their observation-first stance enables them to “let reality be,” maintain neutrality, and support authentic expression without prematurely steering outcomes.

## Implications for training and design

These findings imply that democratic facilitation within educational contexts cannot rely on skills training alone. The core challenge is role-based, not technical. To enable teachers to function as facilitators, their role must be temporarily reconfigured so that non-intervention is legitimized as professional excellence rather than failure.

Effective approaches include explicit role suspension, training in epistemic delay and ambiguity tolerance, externalization and auditing of influence, temporal separation of belief-speaking and fact-speaking, and the use of psychologists or pedagogists as trainers and supervisors. Importantly, not all teachers might be able or willing to adopt this role switch reliably, which suggests the need for role specialization rather than universal conversion.

## Conclusion

The decisive variable for democratic deliberation in educational settings is not authority as such, but the epistemic logic embedded in professional roles. Observation-first roles, such as those of psychologists and pedagogists, are structurally aligned with autonomy-preserving deliberation. Intervention-first roles, such as teaching, require explicit and institutionally supported role transformation if they are to host democratic belief-speaking without reintroducing paternalism.
