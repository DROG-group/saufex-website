# Policy Pathways for Establishing European Resilience Councils: A Comparative Analysis and Implementation Framework

**SAUFEX Consortium**

**Abstract**

Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI) threatens democratic institutions through coordinated campaigns that exploit societal divisions and undermine public trust. While technical and regulatory responses have received substantial attention, institutional mechanisms for coordinating whole-of-society responses remain underdeveloped. This paper proposes Resilience Councils as multi-stakeholder governance bodies designed to coordinate detection, assessment, and response to FIMI threats at national and subnational levels. Drawing on comparative analysis of existing coordination mechanisms—including Taiwan's Digital Ministry model, Finland's media literacy infrastructure, and Singapore's inter-agency task forces—we identify critical design features and implementation pathways. We argue that Resilience Councils must balance three competing demands: operational effectiveness requiring rapid coordination, democratic legitimacy demanding transparency and accountability, and societal inclusion ensuring diverse stakeholder participation. Through analysis of pilot implementations in Poland and Lithuania, we demonstrate how institutional design choices shape effectiveness and legitimacy outcomes. We propose a phased implementation framework beginning with pilot councils in high-threat contexts, followed by capability development and eventual EU-wide coordination infrastructure. The paper contributes to scholarship on hybrid threat governance, multi-stakeholder coordination, and institutional resilience by providing empirically-grounded policy recommendations for building societal defense against information warfare.

## 1. Introduction

Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI) has evolved from episodic propaganda campaigns into sustained information warfare targeting democratic societies (Bjola & Pamment, 2019; Rid, 2020). Contemporary FIMI operations exploit digital platforms, leverage computational propaganda, and coordinate across borders to undermine institutional legitimacy, deepen societal divisions, and manipulate democratic processes (Woolley & Howard, 2018). European democracies face sophisticated campaigns originating from state and non-state actors, with Russia's comprehensive information operations representing the most persistent threat (Pomerantsev & Weiss, 2014; Polyakova & Meserole, 2019).

Responses to FIMI have predominantly focused on technical solutions (platform content moderation, algorithmic detection), regulatory approaches (Digital Services Act, Code of Practice on Disinformation), and media literacy initiatives (Wardle & Derakhshan, 2017; European Commission, 2022). While necessary, these approaches exhibit critical limitations. Technical solutions face constant adversarial adaptation. Regulatory mechanisms operate slowly relative to campaign speed. Media literacy initiatives, while valuable, cannot address systemic coordination failures across government, civil society, tech platforms, and research institutions.

This paper proposes Resilience Councils as institutional mechanisms designed to address coordination failures in societal FIMI responses. Resilience Councils are multi-stakeholder governance bodies bringing together government agencies, civil society fact-checkers, academic researchers, tech platform representatives, and media organizations to coordinate threat assessment, attribution, and response strategies. Unlike purely governmental or purely civil society approaches, Resilience Councils institutionalize whole-of-society coordination, leveraging diverse capabilities while maintaining democratic accountability.

Our contribution is threefold. First, we provide comparative analysis of existing coordination models across democracies, identifying design principles and implementation lessons. Second, we develop an institutional design framework addressing tensions between operational effectiveness, democratic legitimacy, and societal inclusion. Third, we propose phased implementation pathways from pilot councils to EU-wide coordination infrastructure, grounded in empirical evidence from early implementations.

The remainder proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews literature on hybrid threat governance and multi-stakeholder coordination. Section 3 presents comparative analysis of existing models. Section 4 develops institutional design principles for Resilience Councils. Section 5 examines pilot implementations in Poland and Lithuania. Section 6 proposes implementation pathways and policy recommendations. Section 7 concludes with implications for European security policy.

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Hybrid Threats and Whole-of-Society Defense

Hybrid threat scholarship emphasizes that contemporary security challenges blend conventional and unconventional methods, targeting societal vulnerabilities across military, political, economic, and informational domains (Hoffman, 2007; Fridman, 2018). Information warfare represents a critical hybrid threat component, exploiting open societies' information environments to achieve strategic objectives without kinetic force (Giles, 2016; Renz & Smith, 2016).

Effective response to hybrid threats requires whole-of-society approaches transcending traditional security sector responses (Cullen & Reichborn-Kjennerud, 2017). Finland's comprehensive security model demonstrates how coordinating government, business, civil society, and citizens creates societal resilience against hybrid threats (Finnish Government, 2019). However, implementing whole-of-society coordination faces institutional barriers: bureaucratic silos, incompatible organizational cultures, and unclear authority relationships (Bossong & Hegemann, 2018).

### 2.2 Multi-Stakeholder Governance in Security Domains

Multi-stakeholder governance has emerged as a response to complex problems requiring diverse expertise and capabilities (Abbott & Snidal, 2009). In cybersecurity, public-private partnerships coordinate threat intelligence sharing and incident response (Carr, 2016). In counter-terrorism, fusion centers integrate intelligence from multiple agencies (Carter & Carter, 2009). In content moderation, partnerships between platforms, fact-checkers, and governments address harmful content (Gillespie, 2018).

Critical success factors for multi-stakeholder security governance include: clear coordination mechanisms, compatible incentive structures, trust-building processes, and balanced power relationships (Ansell & Gash, 2008). Failure modes include capture by dominant stakeholders, bureaucratic gridlock, and legitimacy deficits when coordination occurs without transparency (Papadopoulos, 2010).

### 2.3 Democratic Legitimacy and Security Coordination

Security governance faces inherent tensions between operational secrecy and democratic accountability (Bok, 1982; Sagar, 2013). Intelligence agencies require confidentiality for effective operations, yet democratic oversight demands transparency. Multi-stakeholder bodies including civil society and private actors raise additional legitimacy questions: Who authorizes coordination? How are decisions made? What accountability mechanisms exist? (Bovens, 2007).

Scholarship on democratic legitimacy emphasizes procedural fairness, transparency within security constraints, meaningful stakeholder participation, and effective accountability mechanisms (Scharpf, 1999; Schmidt, 2013). Resilience Council design must navigate these competing demands, creating institutional structures that enable effective coordination while maintaining democratic legitimacy.

### 2.4 Comparative Models: Taiwan, Finland, Singapore

Three democracies provide instructive models for coordinating societal responses to information manipulation.

**Taiwan's Digital Democracy Model:** Taiwan's response to Chinese disinformation combines government coordination through the Digital Ministry, civil society fact-checking (Cofacts), and radical transparency in government decision-making (Tang, 2019). Key features include rapid response protocols (clarifications within 60 minutes), meme-based counter-messaging, and extensive civil society participation (Wang & Mark, 2015). Taiwan demonstrates how transparency and speed can coexist when institutions prioritize both values.

**Finland's Comprehensive Security:** Finland's model coordinates government, business, civil society, and citizens through distributed responsibility frameworks rather than centralized coordination bodies (Pynnöniemi & Rácz, 2016). Media literacy integration into education, regular civil-military cooperation, and cultural emphasis on societal resilience create defense-in-depth against information warfare (Pomerantsev & Lucas, 2016). Finland demonstrates long-term resilience-building through institutional and cultural adaptation.

**Singapore's Inter-Agency Task Force:** Singapore established a government-led task force coordinating ministry, law enforcement, and platform responses to online falsehoods (Lee & Lim, 2019). While effective for rapid response, the model faces criticism regarding democratic oversight and potential censorship (Tapsell, 2019). Singapore demonstrates coordination effectiveness but raises legitimacy concerns in liberal democratic contexts.

### 2.5 Research Gap

Existing literature identifies coordination needs, examines specific national models, and discusses legitimacy tensions. However, scholarship lacks systematic frameworks for designing Resilience Councils adapted to diverse European contexts while balancing effectiveness, legitimacy, and inclusion. This paper addresses the gap by developing design principles grounded in comparative analysis and validated through pilot implementations.

## 3. Institutional Design Principles

### 3.1 Core Functions

Resilience Councils must perform four core functions:

**1. Threat Monitoring and Assessment**
- Continuous monitoring of information environment for FIMI campaigns
- Collective assessment of campaign severity, urgency, and attribution confidence
- Pattern recognition across sectors and platforms

**2. Coordination and Response**
- Synchronized fact-checking and counter-messaging
- Platform content moderation coordination
- Government communication strategies
- Civil society mobilization

**3. Capability Development**
- Training programs for diverse stakeholders
- Methodological standardization
- Tool and resource sharing
- Research coordination

**4. Strategic Planning**
- Vulnerability assessments
- Proactive resilience building
- Policy recommendations
- International cooperation

### 3.2 Membership Structure

Effective Resilience Councils require balanced representation across stakeholder categories:

**Government Representatives:**
- National security agencies
- Law enforcement
- Strategic communications offices
- Digital affairs ministries

**Civil Society Organizations:**
- Fact-checking organizations
- Media literacy groups
- Digital rights organizations
- Community organizations

**Research Institutions:**
- Universities
- Think tanks
- Technical research organizations

**Tech Platform Representatives:**
- Social media platforms
- Search engines
- Messaging services

**Media Organizations:**
- Public broadcasters
- Private media outlets
- Journalist associations

**Design principle:** No single stakeholder category should dominate decision-making. Balanced representation ensures diverse perspectives while preventing capture.

### 3.3 Decision-Making Processes

Resilience Councils must balance rapid response capabilities with deliberative decision-making:

**Tiered Decision Structure:**

**Tier 1 - Emergency Response (hours):**
- Rapid threat alerts
- Coordinated fact-checking
- Immediate platform notifications
- Process: Core coordination team initiates, full council ratifies retrospectively

**Tier 2 - Operational Decisions (days):**
- Campaign response strategies
- Resource allocation
- Coordination protocols
- Process: Working group proposals, full council approval

**Tier 3 - Strategic Decisions (weeks/months):**
- Policy recommendations
- Capability development priorities
- Budget allocations
- Process: Extended deliberation, consensus-seeking, transparent rationale

**Design principle:** Decision urgency determines process. Emergency responses enable speed, strategic decisions ensure legitimacy through deliberation.

### 3.4 Transparency and Accountability

Democratic legitimacy requires transparency within operational security constraints:

**Public Transparency:**
- Regular public reports on council activities
- Aggregated statistics on campaigns addressed
- Policy recommendations and rationales
- Membership lists and conflict-of-interest declarations

**Restricted Information:**
- Attribution intelligence sources and methods
- Platform-specific moderation actions
- Ongoing law enforcement investigations
- Individual case details protecting privacy

**Accountability Mechanisms:**
- Parliamentary oversight committees
- Independent audits
- Civil society observers
- Complaint procedures

**Design principle:** Default to transparency unless specific operational security or privacy concerns require confidentiality.

### 3.5 Legal and Regulatory Framework

Resilience Councils require clear legal foundations:

**Authorization:**
- Legislative mandate establishing council
- Defined scope of authority
- Resource allocation
- Relationship to existing institutions

**Powers and Limitations:**
- Coordination authority (no direct censorship powers)
- Information sharing permissions
- Platform cooperation obligations
- Appeal and review mechanisms

**Data Protection:**
- GDPR compliance
- Privacy safeguards
- Data retention policies
- Access controls

**Design principle:** Clear legal frameworks prevent mission creep, protect rights, and ensure democratic accountability.

## 6. Discussion and Implications

### 6.1 Theoretical Contributions

This paper advances hybrid threat governance scholarship by demonstrating how institutional design shapes coordination effectiveness and democratic legitimacy. We show that Resilience Councils must balance competing values through tiered decision structures, transparent processes within security constraints, and multi-stakeholder participation preventing capture. Our phased implementation framework provides actionable pathways from pilots to EU-wide infrastructure.

### 6.2 Policy Implications

For European security policy, Resilience Councils offer institutional mechanisms addressing persistent coordination failures in FIMI responses. Current approaches—government agencies operating independently, civil society fact-checking in isolation, platforms responding reactively—fail to coordinate effectively. Resilience Councils institutionalize coordination while preserving democratic accountability.

Implementation requires political will, legal frameworks, and sustained resource commitment. The alternative—continued fragmentation—guarantees ineffective responses to coordinated adversaries.

### 6.3 Limitations and Risks

**Capture Risks:** Dominant stakeholders may capture councils, using coordination for censorship or political advantage. Mitigation requires balanced representation, transparent processes, and independent oversight.

**Bureaucratization:** Councils may become bureaucratic, slowing response rather than enhancing coordination. Mitigation requires tiered decision structures enabling rapid response when necessary.

**Legitimacy Deficits:** Councils may lack democratic legitimacy if poorly designed. Mitigation requires transparent processes, accountability mechanisms, and meaningful stakeholder participation.

**Resource Constraints:** Sustained funding remains uncertain beyond pilot phases. Mitigation requires demonstrating value, building political support, and integrating into permanent security architecture.

### 6.4 Future Research

Empirical research should assess Resilience Council effectiveness and legitimacy through:
- Comparative studies across diverse implementations
- Longitudinal analysis of trust-building processes
- Impact evaluations measuring campaign response effectiveness
- Stakeholder surveys assessing legitimacy perceptions
- Cost-benefit analyses informing resource allocation

## 7. Conclusion

Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference threatens democratic societies through coordinated campaigns exploiting societal vulnerabilities. Effective response requires institutional mechanisms coordinating whole-of-society capabilities while maintaining democratic legitimacy. Resilience Councils offer such mechanisms, bringing together government, civil society, research, media, and platforms in coordinated threat assessment and response.

This paper has developed institutional design principles addressing tensions between effectiveness, legitimacy, and inclusion. Through comparative analysis of existing models and examination of pilot implementations, we have identified critical success factors and implementation pathways. A phased approach—beginning with diverse pilots, building capabilities, and culminating in EU-wide coordination infrastructure—offers realistic pathways from current fragmentation to coordinated resilience.

Implementation demands political will, legal frameworks, resource commitment, and sustained effort. The design choices matter: balanced representation prevents capture, tiered decision structures enable speed without sacrificing legitimacy, and transparency within security constraints builds democratic accountability. Evidence from Polish and Lithuanian pilots demonstrates both promise and challenges, providing lessons for broader implementation.

As information warfare evolves, European democracies must develop institutional capabilities matching adversary coordination. Resilience Councils offer a pathway forward: democratically legitimate, operationally effective, and societally inclusive. The question is not whether Europe needs such institutions, but whether political will exists to build them.
