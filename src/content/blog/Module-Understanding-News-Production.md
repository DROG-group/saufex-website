You see "breaking news" on your phone. Within an hour, the story changes. Details are added, others removed. A correction appears.

Is this evidence the news is "fake"? No - it's evidence of journalism working. Understanding how news is produced helps you evaluate its credibility.

## The News Production Process

Professional journalism involves multiple stages:

**Reporting**: Gathering information from sources, documents, and observation

**Verification**: Confirming information through multiple sources

**Writing**: Presenting findings clearly and accurately

**Editing**: Checking facts, clarity, and adherence to standards

**Publication**: Releasing to audience

Each stage includes quality controls that distinguish journalism from rumor-spreading.

### The Role of Editors

Editors are journalism's quality assurance:

- Verify reporters' sources and fact-checking
- Challenge assumptions and ask hard questions
- Ensure balance and fairness
- Check for legal issues (libel, privacy)
- Improve clarity and accuracy

Good outlets maintain separation between reporters and subjects to ensure independent editing oversight.

## News vs. Opinion

One crucial distinction: news reporting and opinion are different products with different standards.

**News**: Aims for objectivity, multiple sources, verification, edited for accuracy

**Opinion**: Clearly identified perspectives, argue for conclusions, fact-checked but openly subjective

Both are legitimate, but only if clearly labeled. When opinion masquerades as news, you're being misled.

### Spotting the Difference

News stories:

- Use neutral language
- Include multiple perspectives
- Attribute claims to sources
- Avoid first-person
- Focus on what happened

Opinion pieces:

- Use evaluative language ("should," "must")
- Argue for conclusions
- Often first-person
- Explicitly labeled "Opinion" or "Commentary"
- Focus on what it means or what should be done

## Breaking News vs. Full Story

Early reports are often incomplete or contain errors. This isn't failure - it's how journalism works:

**Initial**: Basic facts, may change as more information emerges

**Developing**: Additional details, corrections to early errors

**Complete**: Full context, verification complete

Credible outlets correct errors transparently. Lack of updates or corrections is more suspicious than evolving stories.

## Sources and Attribution

Professional journalism attributes information:

"According to police reports..."

"Data from the Department of Labor shows..."

"Three witnesses told reporters that..."

This allows readers to evaluate credibility and verify independently. Vague attribution ("sources say," "people are saying") without specifics is a red flag.

### On and Off the Record

Journalists use different source agreements:

**On the record**: Can be quoted by name

**Background**: Information can be used but not attributed to specific source

**Off the record**: Information cannot be published, used only to guide further reporting

This allows sources to share sensitive information while journalists maintain credibility through verification.

## The Business of News

News is mostly a business, which creates pressures:

- **Speed vs. accuracy**: Racing to publish first vs. getting it right
- **Engagement vs. importance**: Covering what gets clicks vs. what matters
- **Access vs. independence**: Maintaining source relationships vs. critical coverage

Understanding these tensions helps you evaluate coverage quality. Good outlets navigate them through strong editorial standards.

## Corrections and Accountability

How outlets handle errors reveals their commitment to accuracy:

**Good practice**: Transparent corrections, visible and specific

**Suspicious**: Quietly editing without noting changes

**Bad practice**: Refusing to correct or acknowledge errors

Nobody gets everything right. What matters is how mistakes are handled.

## Journalism Standards

Professional outlets follow ethical standards:

- Verify information through multiple sources
- Seek comments from all sides of controversial issues
- Distinguish clearly between news and opinion
- Disclose conflicts of interest
- Correct errors promptly and transparently
- Protect confidential sources

Standards vary across outlets, but these core principles guide quality journalism.

## Evaluating News Sources

When evaluating news, ask:

- Does this outlet have clear editorial standards?
- Do they correct errors transparently?
- Is news clearly separated from opinion?
- Are sources attributed specifically?
- Do they seek multiple perspectives?
- Is there editorial oversight (not just one person publishing)?

Understanding production processes helps you distinguish professional journalism from content designed to deceive.
