# Module: Evaluating Sources

By **SAUFEX Consortium** | Last Updated: **23 January 2026**

Imagine finding an article claiming a major scientific breakthrough. Before sharing it with friends, you should ask: Is this source trustworthy?

Every day, you encounter hundreds of information sources online. Learning to evaluate their credibility is essential for navigating the modern information environment.

## The Three A's: Authority, Accuracy, Agenda

When evaluating any source, ask three fundamental questions:

**Authority**: Who created this? Are they qualified?

**Accuracy**: Can this be verified? What's the evidence?

**Agenda**: Why was this created? What's the purpose?

[screen 3]

## Authority: Who's Behind This?

Start by identifying the author or organization. Look for:

• Real names (not pseudonyms or anonymous accounts)

• Credentials relevant to the topic

• Track record on similar topics

• Organizational transparency (About Us page, contact information)

Be suspicious of sources that hide their identity.

## Checking Credentials

A medical doctor discussing climate science isn't necessarily authoritative - credentials must match the topic. Similarly, a blog calling itself "Institute" or "Foundation" isn't automatically legitimate.

Search the author's name plus "credentials" or "background." Check if they're recognized by relevant professional organizations or institutions.

## Accuracy: Can You Verify It?

Credible sources provide evidence for their claims:

• Citations to primary sources (research papers, official documents)

• Links to supporting information

• Specific data with sources identified

• Multiple confirming sources for major claims

Vague claims like "studies show" or "experts say" without specifics are red flags.

## The SIFT Method

Information literacy experts recommend "SIFT":

**Stop**: Don't share immediately

**Investigate** the source

**Find** better coverage

**Trace** claims to original sources

This takes seconds but dramatically improves your ability to spot unreliable information.

## Agenda: What's the Purpose?

Every information source has a purpose. Understanding it helps you evaluate credibility:

• News organizations aim to inform (though they may have political leanings)

• Marketing content aims to sell

• Advocacy groups aim to persuade

• Academic sources aim to advance knowledge

None of these purposes makes information automatically false - but knowing the agenda helps you read critically.

## Warning Signs of Unreliable Sources

Watch for these red flags:

• Sensational headlines that don't match article content

• No author identified or anonymous authorship

• No dates or very old information presented as current

• Poor grammar and spelling

• Ads disguised as news

• No sources cited for controversial claims

One red flag doesn't automatically mean false, but multiple flags warrant skepticism.

## Practice Makes Perfect

Source evaluation is a skill that improves with practice. Start by applying these questions to three articles you encounter today:

Who created this? Why should I trust them? Can I verify this elsewhere?

Over time, these checks become second nature, protecting you from misinformation while helping you find reliable information.
