# Module: Assessing FIMI Impact


[screen 1]

Did Russian interference change the outcome of the 2016 US election? Did FIMI operations affect the Brexit vote? Do COVID-19 disinformation campaigns cost lives?

These questions matter enormously - but they're exceptionally difficult to answer with confidence. Understanding FIMI impact requires grappling with complex methodology and acknowledging uncertainty.

[screen 2]

## Why Impact Assessment Matters

Understanding FIMI effectiveness helps:

• **Resource allocation**: Investing in defenses proportional to threat

• **Policy responses**: Designing appropriate countermeasures

• **Public awareness**: Communicating the nature and scale of threats

• **Deterrence**: Demonstrating consequences to adversaries

• **Learning**: Understanding what works and what doesn't

But impact assessment faces fundamental methodological challenges that make definitive conclusions difficult.

## Levels of Impact

FIMI impact operates at multiple levels:

**Reach**: How many people saw the content?

**Engagement**: How many interacted with it?

**Attention**: Did it receive meaningful attention or just scroll-by?

**Belief**: Did people believe the claims?

**Attitude change**: Did it shift opinions?

**Behavior**: Did it affect actions (voting, vaccination, etc.)?

**Outcomes**: Did it change election results, policy, or events?

Each level is harder to measure than the last.

## Measuring Reach and Engagement

Platform data can quantify exposure:

• Number of accounts reached

• Impressions and views

• Likes, shares, comments

• Time spent engaging

Example: Facebook reported Russian IRA content reached 126 million Americans before 2016 election. This measures exposure, not effect.

But reach alone doesn't indicate impact - millions see content they ignore or disbelieve.

## The Organic Amplification Question

FIMI operations seed content, but authentic users amplify it:

• How much reach came from inauthentic accounts vs organic sharing?

• At what point did content become self-sustaining?

• Would it have spread without foreign seeding?

Distinguishing foreign manipulation from organic discourse is analytically challenging - and politically fraught.

## Narrative Penetration

Assessing whether narratives entered public consciousness:

**Indicators**:
• Media coverage of FIMI-seeded stories

• Political figures repeating claims

• Survey data showing belief in specific narratives

• Search trends related to false claims

Narrative penetration can occur even if people don't fully believe - false claims shape the questions being debated.

[screen 7]

## Attitude Change Measurement

Determining if FIMI operations changed opinions requires:

**Surveys**: Tracking belief in specific claims over time (but correlation ≠ causation)

**Experimental studies**: Exposing people to content and measuring effects (but artificial conditions)

**Natural experiments**: Comparing exposed vs unexposed populations (but confounding variables)

All methods have limitations. Isolating FIMI effects from other influences is nearly impossible in real-world settings.

[screen 8]

## The Counterfactual Problem

The hardest question: What would have happened without FIMI?

• Would Trump have won without Russian interference?

• Would Brexit vote have been different without foreign amplification?

• How many people died from COVID misinformation?

We can't rerun history without FIMI to find out. This makes definitive impact claims impossible - we can only assess likelihood and contributing factors.

[screen 9]

## Electoral Impact Debates

Assessing election influence is especially contentious:

**Arguments for significant impact**:
• Close elections where small shifts matter
• Documented reach of millions of voters
• Narrative penetration into mainstream discourse
• Targeting of swing voters in key states

**Arguments for limited impact**:
• Most content reached people already decided
• Exposure doesn't equal persuasion
• Domestic factors (candidates, campaigns, economy) likely more important
• Polarization already existed before FIMI

Honest assessment: Contributed to information environment, but magnitude unknown.

## Public Health Impact

Health misinformation has measurable consequences:

• Vaccination rates correlated with exposure to anti-vax content

• Adoption of ineffective or dangerous "treatments"

• Rejection of public health measures

• Observable health outcomes (disease spread, hospitalizations, deaths)

Still, isolating foreign manipulation from domestic misinformation is difficult. But public health effects of misinformation (regardless of origin) are documentable.

[screen 11]

## Societal Polarization

FIMI operations often aim to increase division:

**Measurable indicators**:
• Polarization indexes over time
• Trust in institutions declining
• Political violence increases
• Social cohesion metrics

But many factors contribute to polarization beyond FIMI. Foreign operations amplify existing tensions - they rarely create them from nothing.

Assessment: FIMI contributes to polarization, but quantifying its share is difficult.

[screen 12]

## Long-Term vs. Short-Term Effects

FIMI impact varies by timeframe:

**Short-term**:
• Immediate engagement and reach
• Trending topics and news cycles
• Election day behavior

**Long-term**:
• Cumulative erosion of trust
• Normalization of conspiracy thinking
• Increased polarization
• Weakened democratic institutions

Long-term effects may be more significant but harder to measure. The goal isn't always immediate persuasion but gradual degradation of information environment.

[screen 13]

## Methodological Challenges

Impact assessment faces fundamental obstacles:

• **Selection bias**: People choose what content to consume

• **Confounding variables**: Many factors influence attitudes and behavior

• **Measurement**: Hard to track exposure across platforms and over time

• **Causation**: Correlation doesn't prove FIMI caused observed changes

• **Self-reporting**: Survey responses may not reflect true beliefs or behavior

• **Ethical limits**: Can't experimentally expose people to harmful content to measure effects

These challenges mean conclusions require qualifications and acknowledgment of uncertainty.

[screen 14]

## Cost-Benefit from Adversary Perspective

Assessing FIMI success from actor perspective:

**Low costs**:
• Information operations cheap relative to military or traditional intelligence

• Plausible deniability reduces diplomatic costs

• Persistence possible even after exposure

**Potential benefits**:
• Influence democratic processes

• Undermine alliances and trust

• Justify geopolitical actions

• Defend against criticism

Even if effects are uncertain or modest, favorable cost-benefit ratio encourages continued operations.

[screen 15]

## The Perception Impact

FIMI affects perceptions regardless of measurable outcomes:

• Awareness of foreign manipulation increases suspicion and uncertainty

• Opponents of election results can cite foreign interference (whether it mattered or not)

• Undermines confidence in democratic processes

• Creates pretext for authoritarian measures

"Nothing is true and everything is possible" - even perception of widespread manipulation serves some actors' interests.

[screen 16]

## What We Can Say With Confidence

Despite measurement challenges, some conclusions are defensible:

• FIMI operations reach millions of people

• Foreign-seeded narratives enter mainstream discourse

• Operations exploit and amplify existing divisions

• Effects likely vary by context (close elections, crises)

• Contributing factor among many, not sole determinant

• Long-term cumulative effects may exceed short-term measurable impacts

• Enough evidence of harm to justify defensive investments

[screen 17]

## Implications for Defense

Impact assessment uncertainty doesn't mean inaction:

• We don't need to quantify exact impact to justify defense

• Protecting information integrity is valuable regardless of precise effects

• Prevention is easier than measuring after-the-fact impact

• Building resilience addresses multiple threats simultaneously

• Democratic values justify defending information space even without perfect impact metrics

Impact assessment informs strategy, but defense doesn't require certainty about past effects - reasonable concern about potential harm suffices.
