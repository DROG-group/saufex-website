# Module: Basic FIMI Concepts

By **SAUFEX Consortium** | Last Updated: **23 January 2026**

[screen 1]

You've probably heard about "election interference" or "foreign influence campaigns." These are examples of what experts call FIMI: Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference.

But what exactly is FIMI, and why should you care?

[screen 2]

## What is FIMI?

FIMI is information operations conducted by foreign actors - usually governments or their proxies - intended to manipulate public opinion, undermine trust in institutions, or interfere with democratic processes.

Unlike simple disinformation, FIMI is organized, resourced, and strategically targeted by external actors.

Think of FIMI as information warfare. Instead of military weapons, foreign actors use false narratives, leaked documents, manipulated media, and coordinated online campaigns to achieve their goals.

The targets? Your beliefs, your trust, your votes, and ultimately, your democracy.

## FIMI vs Domestic Disinformation

Not all disinformation is FIMI. Your neighbor sharing a false story on Facebook isn't FIMI. A domestic political group spreading misleading ads isn't FIMI.

FIMI specifically involves foreign actors with strategic interests in destabilizing or influencing your country.

However, the lines can blur. Foreign actors often amplify existing domestic divisions. They don't need to create conflict - they just pour fuel on existing fires.

A domestic conspiracy theory might be boosted by foreign troll farms. A genuine protest movement might be infiltrated by foreign provocateurs.

## Why Do Foreign Actors Do This?

FIMI campaigns serve various strategic goals:

• Undermine trust in democratic institutions and processes

• Amplify social divisions and polarization

• Interfere with elections to favor specific candidates

• Distract from their own domestic or international problems

• Justify military or political actions through false narratives

## Real-World Examples

In 2016, Russian actors interfered in the US presidential election through social media manipulation, hacked email releases, and coordinated disinformation campaigns.

In 2022, China ran coordinated campaigns to spread false narratives about COVID-19 origins and Western responses.

These aren't isolated incidents - FIMI is ongoing, targeting democracies worldwide.

## Why FIMI Matters to Democracy

Democracy depends on informed citizens making free choices. FIMI attacks this foundation by:

• Polluting the information environment with false narratives

• Eroding trust between citizens and institutions

• Creating confusion about what's true and what matters

When citizens can't agree on basic facts, democratic deliberation becomes impossible.

## Your Role

Understanding FIMI is the first step in defending against it. You're not powerless.

By recognizing foreign manipulation tactics, questioning suspiciously divisive content, and supporting trusted information sources, you help protect democratic processes.

In later modules, you'll learn specific techniques to identify and counter FIMI.
