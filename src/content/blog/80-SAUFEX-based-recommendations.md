# (80) SAUFEX-based recommendations


With project SAUFEX being halfway, it is time to formulate recommendations regarding dealing with the information sphere, based on preliminary project outcomes.

## 1. To ensure long-term societal resilience, sustainable institutional support is required to establish a unified operational and strategic framework

To harmonize the diverse adoption and understanding of FIMI tools (e.g., DISARM, STIX, OpenCTI, ABCDE) across countries:

\* Develop a standardized taxonomy and terminology for FIMI incidents, responses, and reporting to ensure consistent communication and analysis.

\* Distribute an OpenCTI starter kit with pre-configured TTPs, datasets, and standardized reporting templates to streamline adoption.

\* Publish best practice guides, regularly updated knowledge and trend databases, and tiered response frameworks to support coordinated action.

\* Implement certified training programs with structured learning paths to enhance expertise in FIMI detection, analysis, and response.

## 2\. To ensure long-term societal resilience, sustainable institutional support is required to decentralize and democratize the information sphere

Countries adopt varied approaches to managing the information sphere. To promote resilience and inclusivity, adopt these common principles:

\* Enhance platform accountability regarding illegal content;

\* Establish Resilience Councils as all-of-society participation hubs to foster collaborative policy-making, leveraging their outputs of evidence-informed analysis and citizen reflections;

\* First, enhance citizen democratic competencies. Then, enhance specific literacies (e.g. media literacy, digital literacy, AI literacy, citizen education).

## Second half

Recommendations on AI and other relevant topics will be drafted in the second half of the project. Preliminary recommendations on AI were published in [blog post seventy-seven](/insights/77-Two-AI-literacy-recommendations).
