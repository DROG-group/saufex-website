# Module: Defending Against Hybrid Threats

By **SAUFEX Consortium** | Last Updated: **23 January 2026**

Hybrid threats are complex, adaptive, and multi-domain. Can they be defended against?

Yes - but defense requires moving beyond traditional security approaches. Effective defense demands resilience across society, coordination across government, and active participation by citizens.

This module presents a comprehensive defense framework.

## The Resilience Paradigm

Traditional security focused on deterrence and defense at borders. Hybrid threats operate inside societies, exploiting internal vulnerabilities.

This requires shifting from purely defensive postures to building societal resilience - the ability to withstand, adapt to, and recover from hybrid operations while maintaining democratic values and social cohesion.

### Four Pillars of Resilience

**Awareness**: Understanding the threats and how they operate

**Resistance**: Reducing vulnerabilities that adversaries exploit

**Recovery**: Quickly restoring normal function after attacks

**Adaptation**: Learning from attacks to strengthen future defense

Each pillar requires coordinated action across government, private sector, and civil society.

## Multi-Domain Defense

Because hybrid threats operate across domains, defense must too:

**Information domain**: Counter-narratives, media literacy, platform resilience

**Cyber domain**: Critical infrastructure protection, rapid attribution

**Economic domain**: Supply chain resilience, sanctions coordination

**Political domain**: Election security, foreign influence transparency

**Social domain**: Community cohesion, trust in institutions

No single domain defense suffices - integration is essential.

## Early Warning and Attribution

Effective response requires early detection. This demands:

• **Intelligence fusion**: Combining signals from multiple sources and domains

• **Horizon scanning**: Monitoring for indicators of preparation

• **Pattern recognition**: Identifying coordinated campaigns early

• **Rapid attribution**: Determining adversary identity quickly enough to enable response

Many democracies have improved these capabilities since 2016, but gaps remain.

## Institutional Coordination

Hybrid threats don't respect organizational boundaries. Defense requires coordination:

• **Horizontal**: Across government departments (foreign affairs, defense, intelligence, law enforcement, communications)

• **Vertical**: Between national, regional, and local levels

• **External**: With private sector (especially tech platforms) and civil society

Some countries have created specific coordination bodies like Resilience Councils to achieve this.

## International Cooperation

Hybrid threat actors often operate across borders. Effective defense requires:

• **Intelligence sharing**: Coordinating threat information among allies

• **Attribution coordination**: Joint statements increase credibility and reduce isolation

• **Response coordination**: Synchronized actions (sanctions, expulsions, cyber responses)

• **Capability building**: Helping vulnerable allies strengthen defenses

NATO, EU, and other alliances have enhanced hybrid threat cooperation frameworks.

## The Information Battlefield

Since information manipulation is central to hybrid threats, information defense is critical:

**Pre-bunking**: Inoculating populations against manipulation before it occurs

**Rapid response**: Quickly countering false narratives with facts

**Strategic communication**: Proactive messaging that advances democratic values

**Media literacy**: Educating citizens to critically evaluate information

**Platform accountability**: Requiring tech companies to address manipulation on their services

[screen 9]

## Critical Infrastructure Protection

Hybrid operations often target infrastructure. Protection requires:

• Identifying critical systems and dependencies

• Reducing digital attack surfaces

• Building redundancy and backup systems

• Practicing crisis response scenarios

• Coordinating with infrastructure operators (often private companies)

Both physical and digital infrastructure need attention.

## Democratic Values as Strength

Some advocate restricting freedoms to defend against hybrid threats. This is counterproductive - it achieves adversary objectives.

Instead, democratic values can be strengths:

**Transparency**: Open societies better detect foreign manipulation

**Free press**: Independent media investigates and exposes operations

**Civil society**: NGOs and activists provide early warning

**Rule of law**: Legal frameworks enable measured, legitimate responses

The challenge is defending these values, not abandoning them.

[screen 11]

## Whole-of-Society Approach

Governments alone cannot defend against hybrid threats. Everyone has a role:

**Citizens**: Critical thinking, reporting suspicious activity, social cohesion

**Media**: Fact-checking, investigative journalism, responsible reporting

**Tech companies**: Platform security, content moderation, transparency

**Academia**: Research, education, expertise

**Private sector**: Infrastructure security, supply chain resilience

When society acts together, resilience multiplies.

## Your Role in Defense

As an individual, you contribute to hybrid threat defense by:

• Staying informed about threats without panic

• Practicing media literacy and critical thinking

• Not amplifying suspicious content

• Supporting quality journalism

• Reporting suspicious activity to authorities

• Building community connections that resist manipulation

• Voting and participating in democratic processes

• Supporting evidence-based policy responses

Personal resilience creates societal resilience.

## Looking Forward

Hybrid threats will evolve as adversaries adapt and technologies change. Defense must evolve too.

Priority areas for development:

• AI-enabled detection and response systems

• Faster attribution capabilities

• Enhanced public-private coordination

• Improved media literacy at scale

• Resilience metrics and assessment

• International legal frameworks for gray zone operations

Continued investment in resilience and coordination is essential.
