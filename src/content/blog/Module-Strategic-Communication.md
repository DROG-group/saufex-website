Foreign adversaries spread disinformation about democratic institutions. Coordinated campaigns undermine social cohesion. Hostile narratives poison public discourse.

Individual fact-checks aren't sufficient - coordinated strategic communication is necessary. Understanding StratCom approaches reveals how governments and institutions defend the information environment.

[screen 2]

## What Is Strategic Communication?

StratCom is coordinated, purposeful institutional communication:

**Definition**: Deliberate, coordinated communication by governments or organizations to achieve specific objectives

**Characteristics**:
- Multiple coordinated messages
- Multi-channel approach
- Targeted audiences
- Sustained campaigns (not one-off)
- Integration with policy actions
- Measurement and adaptation

**Contrast with**:
- Ad-hoc responses
- Individual corrections
- Uncoordinated messaging

StratCom is systematic, not reactive.

## Why StratCom Matters for FIMI

FIMI operations require coordinated responses:

**FIMI characteristics demanding StratCom**:
- Coordinated multi-platform campaigns
- Sustained operations over time
- State resources and sophistication
- Strategic objectives
- Adaptive tactics

**StratCom responses**:
- Coordinated counter-messaging
- Attribution and exposure
- Narrative alternatives
- Audience resilience building
- Integration with sanctions/policy

Individual debunks insufficient against coordinated state campaigns.

## EU East StratCom Task Force

Model case of institutional StratCom:

**Established**: 2015, response to Russian disinformation around Ukraine

**Structure**: European External Action Service unit

**Activities**:
- EUvsDisinfo database of disinformation cases
- Weekly disinformation reviews
- Positive communication about EU to Eastern Partnership countries
- Support for independent media
- Media literacy initiatives
- Coordinating EU member state responses

**Impact**:
- Thousands of documented disinformation cases
- Increased awareness of FIMI tactics
- Model for other regional StratCom efforts

Demonstrates institutional StratCom in practice.

## Strategic Communication Components

Effective StratCom integrates multiple elements:

**1. Monitoring**: Continuous information environment observation

**2. Analysis**: Understanding adversary narratives and tactics

**3. Attribution**: Identifying and exposing perpetrators

**4. Message development**: Crafting effective counter-messages

**5. Dissemination**: Multi-channel delivery

**6. Amplification**: Partnerships for reach

**7. Measurement**: Tracking effectiveness

**8. Adaptation**: Adjusting based on results

**9. Policy integration**: Aligning communication with actions

Comprehensive approach, not just messaging.

[screen 6]

## Target Audience Analysis

Effective StratCom requires knowing your audience:

**Segmentation**:
- Demographics (age, location, education)
- Psychographics (values, beliefs, fears)
- Information consumption patterns
- Vulnerability to specific narratives
- Receptiveness to counter-messages

**Audience types**:
- Committed opponents (low priority)
- Persuadables (highest priority)
- Supporters needing reinforcement
- Neutral/unaware needing information

**Targeting**: Different messages for different segments

One-size-fits-all messaging fails.

[screen 7]

## Message Development Principles

Crafting effective strategic messages:

**Clarity**: Simple, understandable core message

**Credibility**: Evidence-based, from trusted sources

**Consistency**: Coordinated across channels and time

**Repetition**: Key messages repeated (varied phrasing)

**Emotional resonance**: Engaging values and emotions appropriately

**Actionability**: Clear implications or calls to action

**Cultural appropriateness**: Tailored to audience context

**Testing**: Pre-testing messages with target audiences

Good StratCom messages are carefully crafted, not improvised.

[screen 8]

## Proactive vs. Reactive StratCom

Two modes with different purposes:

**Reactive StratCom**:
- Responding to adversary narratives
- Crisis communication
- Damage control
- Necessary but playing defense

**Proactive StratCom**:
- Setting agenda, not just responding
- Positive narrative promotion
- Prebunking anticipated narratives
- Building long-term resilience
- Playing offense

**Balance**: Effective StratCom does both
- React when necessary
- But emphasis on proactive

Initiative advantages attacker; proactive StratCom regains initiative.

[screen 9]

## Attribution as StratCom

Exposing operations as counter-messaging:

**Attribution value**:
- Reveals coordination and inauthenticity
- Discredits exposed accounts/outlets
- Deters future operations (increases cost)
- Enables policy responses (sanctions)
- Inoculates audiences

**Examples**:
- US intelligence declassification about Russian interference
- Facebook/Twitter network removals with attribution
- EUvsDisinfo documentation of Russian disinformation
- Bellingcat investigations attributing operations

**Challenge**: Attribution requires intelligence, evidence

**Effect**: Exposure reduces effectiveness even without belief change

Sunlight as disinfectant.

[screen 10]

## Multi-Channel Coordination

StratCom leverages multiple platforms:

**Channels**:
- Social media platforms
- Traditional media (press, TV, radio)
- Government websites and publications
- Partnerships with civil society
- Educational institutions
- Direct communication (speeches, statements)

**Coordination**:
- Consistent messages across channels
- Channel-appropriate formatting
- Timing synchronization
- Reinforcement through repetition

**Reach**: Different audiences on different channels

Comprehensive coverage requires multi-channel approach.

[screen 11]

## Integration with Policy Actions

Communication without action lacks credibility:

**Policy-StratCom alignment**:
- StratCom explains and justifies policies
- Policies demonstrate commitment, backing messaging
- Sanctions against FIMI actors reinforce attribution
- Legislation signals seriousness
- International coordination shows unity

**Examples**:
- EU sanctions on Russian media outlets + communication about disinformation
- Platform regulation (DSA) + transparency requirements
- Funding for independent media + messaging about media freedom

**Principle**: Walk the talk - actions validate words

Disconnect between messaging and policy undermines credibility.

[screen 12]

## Public Diplomacy vs. StratCom

Related but distinct:

**Public diplomacy**:
- Long-term relationship building
- Cultural exchanges
- Positive image promotion
- Broad audience engagement

**Strategic communication**:
- Specific objectives (often countering threats)
- Targeted messaging
- Campaign-based
- More tactical

**Overlap**: Both involve international communication, perception shaping

**Distinction**: StratCom more focused on countering adversary narratives

StratCom often operates within broader public diplomacy frameworks.

[screen 13]

## Case Study: Countering COVID-19 Misinformation

StratCom applied to pandemic:

**Challenge**: Coordinated misinformation about pandemic, vaccines

**StratCom responses**:
- WHO/government coordinated messaging
- Regular briefings and information campaigns
- Partnership with social media platforms
- Fact-checking programs
- Prebunking campaigns (Go Viral game)
- Myth-busting content
- Trusted messenger programs (doctors, community leaders)

**Lessons**:
- Coordination essential at scale
- Multiple channels needed
- Trust-building crucial
- Sustained effort required

Not perfect, but demonstrated StratCom principles.

## Measuring StratCom Effectiveness

How to know if StratCom works:

**Metrics**:
- Audience reach and engagement
- Message penetration (awareness, recall)
- Attitude change in target audiences
- Behavior change (sharing, participation)
- Adversary narrative prevalence reduction
- Media coverage sentiment
- Policy impact

**Challenges**:
- Attribution problems (many factors influence opinions)
- Long time horizons
- Counterfactual uncertainty
- Qualitative dimensions

**Approach**: Mixed methods (surveys, social media analysis, qualitative assessment)

Imperfect measurement better than none.

[screen 15]

## Ethical Considerations

Government StratCom raises ethical questions:

**Transparency vs. effectiveness**:
- Open about government messaging?
- Covert influence operations problematic
- But: Some tactics require discretion

**Domestic vs. foreign**:
- StratCom targeting foreign audiences less controversial
- Domestic StratCom risks propaganda accusations
- Lines blur in digital environment

**Truth commitment**:
- Democratic StratCom must be truthful
- Using deception undermines credibility and values

**Pluralism respect**:
- StratCom shouldn't suppress legitimate debate
- Focus on demonstrably false claims, not contested opinions

**Accountability**:
- Who oversees StratCom activities?
- Democratic oversight necessary

[screen 16]

## Partnering with Non-Governmental Actors

Government StratCom works with civil society:

**Partnerships**:
- Fact-checkers: Independent verification
- Media organizations: Amplification and credibility
- Academia: Research and expertise
- Civil society: Grassroots reach and trust
- Private sector: Technology and platforms

**Value**:
- Credibility: Non-governmental voices often more trusted
- Reach: Broader audience access
- Independence: Perceived objectivity
- Expertise: Specialized knowledge

**Caution**: Maintaining partner independence while coordinating

Ecosystem approach more effective than government alone.

[screen 17]

## Adversary Adaptation

StratCom faces evolving opposition:

**Adversary responses**:
- Accusing StratCom of propaganda
- Mimicking StratCom language
- Creating fake fact-checking sites
- Exploiting transparency for intelligence
- Adapting tactics to evade detection
- Targeting StratCom credibility

**Counter-adaptation**:
- Continuous monitoring of adversary tactics
- Updating approaches
- Maintaining credibility through truthfulness
- Transparency about methods
- Resilience through multiple approaches

Arms race dynamic requires continuous adaptation.
