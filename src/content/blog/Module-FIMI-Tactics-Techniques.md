# Module: FIMI Tactics and Techniques


[screen 1]

A divisive story appears simultaneously across dozens of seemingly unrelated accounts. Within hours, it trends on multiple platforms. Traditional media picks it up. By the time fact-checkers debunk it, millions have seen it.

This isn't organic virality - it's coordinated manipulation using proven tactics. Understanding these techniques is essential for detection and defense.

[screen 2]

## The FIMI Playbook

While specific operations vary, common tactical patterns emerge:

**Seeding**: Introducing narratives through multiple channels

**Amplification**: Using networks to boost visibility

**Legitimization**: Getting narratives picked up by authentic accounts and media

**Persistence**: Sustaining narratives despite debunking

**Adaptation**: Evolving tactics as platforms respond

These stages often overlap and repeat in sophisticated operations.

[screen 3]

## Fake Accounts and Personas

Inauthentic accounts are fundamental to FIMI operations:

**Bot accounts**: Automated or semi-automated accounts for volume

**Troll accounts**: Human-operated fake personas

**Sock puppets**: One operator controlling multiple personas

**Hijacked accounts**: Compromised legitimate accounts

**Aged accounts**: Built over time to seem authentic before activation

Sophisticated operations use convincing personas with histories, consistent personalities, and realistic activity patterns.

[screen 4]

## Building Believable Personas

Creating credible fake accounts requires effort:

- **Profile photos**: Stolen or AI-generated faces
- **Biographical details**: Consistent, locally relevant information
- **Activity history**: Months of normal-seeming posts before operation
- **Network building**: Connecting with real users
- **Content diversity**: Not just propaganda - also normal social media activity
- **Local knowledge**: Cultural references, language nuances

Well-constructed personas are difficult to distinguish from authentic accounts.

## Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior (CIB)

Platforms increasingly detect not individual fake accounts but coordinated networks:

**Simultaneous posting**: Multiple accounts sharing identical or near-identical content at the same time

**Coordinated engagement**: Networks liking, sharing, and commenting in patterns

**Amplification chains**: Content passing through networks in organized sequence

**Coordinated targeting**: Multiple accounts attacking or defending same targets

CIB detection focuses on patterns rather than content, making it harder to evade.

## Content Strategies

FIMI operations employ diverse content approaches:

**Inflammatory**: Designed to provoke emotional response

**Divisive**: Exploiting existing societal fault lines

**Partially true**: Mixing facts with false conclusions

**Authentic but manipulated**: Real content recontextualized

**Absurd**: Flooding space with contradictory claims to create confusion

**Whataboutism**: Deflecting criticism by pointing to others' problems

Effective operations use sophisticated content, not obvious propaganda.

[screen 7]

## Narrative Laundering

Making foreign propaganda appear organic and credible:

1. **Seed** content on marginal websites or social media

2. **Amplify** through inauthentic networks

3. **Get picked up** by conspiracy sites and fringe media

4. **Further amplification** makes it appear popular

5. **Traditional media reports** on trending content

6. **Politicians and public figures** reference it

7. **Original foreign source** cites Western coverage as validation

This cycle transforms obvious propaganda into seemingly legitimate news.

[screen 8]

## Targeting and Timing

Sophisticated operations carefully target and time content:

**Audience segmentation**: Different messages for different demographics

**Geographic targeting**: Local languages, cultural references, regional issues

**Psychographic targeting**: Personality-based messaging

**Strategic timing**: During elections, crises, or relevant news cycles

**Rapid response**: Exploiting breaking news before fact-checking can respond

**Sustained campaigns**: Long-term narrative building, not just reactive

Targeting precision dramatically increases effectiveness per resource invested.

[screen 9]

## Exploiting Platform Features

FIMI operators understand and exploit platform mechanics:

**Algorithmic amplification**: Creating engagement that algorithms reward

**Hashtag hijacking**: Co-opting trending topics

**Reply-guy tactics**: Inserting narratives into high-visibility conversations

**Community manipulation**: Taking over or creating groups/communities

**Recommendation exploitation**: Getting content into "recommended" feeds

**Cross-platform coordination**: Using multiple platforms simultaneously

Platform-specific tactics evolve as platforms change features and policies.

[screen 10]

## The "Firehose of Falsehood"

A particularly Russian tactic involves overwhelming volume and speed:

**Principle 1: High volume**: Numerous channels, many messages

**Principle 2: Rapid, continuous**: Constant stream, not discrete campaigns

**Principle 3: No commitment to consistency**: Contradictory messages acceptable

**Principle 4: No commitment to objective reality**: Lying without consequence

Goal isn't persuasion but confusion - making truth indistinguishable from falsehood. When everything is false, nothing is true.

[screen 11]

## Integration with Cyber Operations

FIMI often combines with cyber tactics:

**Hack-and-leak**: Stealing and selectively releasing information

**DDoS attacks**: Taking down competing narratives

**Website defacement**: Psychological impact

**Doxing**: Revealing personal information to intimidate

**Malware distribution**: Through manipulated links

Information and cyber operations reinforce each other, creating compound effects.

[screen 12]

## Offline-Online Integration

Sophisticated operations don't stay online:

- Organizing real-world protests
- Creating physical propaganda (posters, billboards)
- Events and conferences
- Funding political organizations
- Cultivating relationships with political figures
- Traditional media placement

Online amplification makes offline activities appear more significant; offline activities lend authenticity to online content.

## Astroturfing

Creating fake grassroots movements:

- Manufacturing appearance of organic public support
- Fake petition signatures
- Coordinated letter-writing campaigns
- Fake protest organizing
- Impersonating activists and organizations

"Astroturf" (fake grass) movements aim to influence policymakers and media by simulating public opinion.

[screen 14]

## Exploiting Mainstream Media

FIMI operations often aim to get mainstream media coverage:

- Creating events newsworthy enough to report
- Flooding social media to create "people are talking about..." stories
- Providing seemingly credible sources for journalists
- Creating controversy that demands coverage
- Gaming trending algorithms

Once in mainstream media, foreign propaganda gains legitimacy and reach far beyond inauthentic networks.

[screen 15]

## Persistence and Adaptation

FIMI operations show remarkable persistence:

**Returning narratives**: Same false claims reappear months or years later

**Tactical evolution**: Adapting to platform countermeasures

**Network regeneration**: Creating new accounts as old ones are removed

**Multi-platform redundancy**: When one platform acts, move to others

**Learning**: Studying what works and doesn't work, improving operations

This persistence means defense requires sustained effort, not one-time fixes.

[screen 16]

## Why These Tactics Work

FIMI techniques exploit fundamental features of information ecosystems:

- **Cognitive biases**: Confirmation bias, emotional reasoning
- **Platform economics**: Engagement-optimizing algorithms
- **Information overload**: Difficulty processing volume
- **Speed asymmetry**: Lies spread faster than corrections
- **Polarization**: Existing divisions easy to exploit
- **Decreasing trust**: Institutional skepticism creates information vacuum

Understanding why tactics work helps design countermeasures that address root vulnerabilities.
