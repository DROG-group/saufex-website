**Purpose**: You'll learn what AI actually changes about information manipulation, distinguish genuine AI-enabled threats from hype, and develop frameworks for assessing AI-related claims.

---

[screen 1]

## Starting Point

AI will destroy democracy. AI-generated content is everywhere. We can't trust anything anymore.

You've heard these claims. Some contain truth. Most contain more anxiety than analysis.

AI does change information manipulation. But understanding *how* requires precision, not panic. The goal here is to give you a framework for thinking about AI threats — not a list of things to fear.

---

## What AI Actually Does

Generative AI — systems that produce new content — can create:

**Text**: Articles, comments, emails, social media posts
**Images**: Photorealistic scenes, manipulated photos, diagrams
**Audio**: Voice cloning, synthetic speech, audio fakes
**Video**: Face swaps, synthetic talking heads, full scene generation

This is real. These capabilities exist. The question is: what does this change, practically?

---

## The "Everything Is Fake" Trap

A common mistake: assuming AI changes everything.

**Reality check:**
- Most disinformation still doesn't require AI
- Text-based manipulation works with or without LLMs
- Human-created content remains abundant
- AI-generated content isn't automatically more effective

The apocalyptic framing ("we can't trust anything") is itself a form of information manipulation — paralyzing rather than empowering.

Your job: distinguish what AI actually enables from what it doesn't change.

## Three Things AI Changes

AI does transform some aspects of information manipulation:

**1. Production costs**
- Creating text, image, audio content is cheaper
- Variations and translations automated
- Volume possible at lower investment

**2. Speed**
- Reactive campaigns faster to deploy
- Content can match real-time events
- Iteration and optimization accelerated

**3. Personalization potential**
- Tailored messaging at scale
- Language and style matching
- Targeted emotional appeals

These are real shifts. But they're shifts in capability, not magical transformations.

---

[screen 5]

## What AI Doesn't Change

Despite the hype, fundamentals remain:

**Distribution still matters**
- AI-generated content needs to reach audiences
- Platform dynamics, seeding, amplification unchanged
- "Making fake content" ≠ "making it spread"

**Detection remains possible**
- AI-generated content has artifacts
- Behavioral analysis still works
- Metadata and provenance leave traces

**Human psychology unchanged**
- People still have biases, trust networks, verification habits
- What makes content persuasive isn't primarily its production method
- Emotional resonance matters more than AI sophistication

---

[screen 6]

## The Asymmetry Problem (Real But Nuanced)

Commonly stated: "AI makes creation faster than detection."

This is partly true:
- LLMs can generate text faster than humans can read it
- Image generation outpaces manual verification
- Scale is genuinely challenging

But consider:
- Detection can be automated too
- Not all AI content requires individual verification
- Behavioral signals often matter more than content authenticity
- "Winning" isn't about detecting every fake

The asymmetry is real but manageable with the right approach.

## AI for Text: Capabilities and Limits

**Large Language Models (GPT, Claude, Llama, etc.) can:**
- Write fluent text in any style
- Generate multiple variations
- Translate between languages
- Adopt personas

**What this enables:**
- Higher volume operations with less labor
- Consistent voice across many accounts
- Faster translation and localization

**What it doesn't enable:**
- Automatic credibility
- Guaranteed virality
- Immunity from behavioral detection

A thousand AI-generated comments still need to come from accounts, follow patterns, exhibit behaviors.

---

[screen 8]

## AI for Images: Beyond "Photoshop"

**Image generation tools can:**
- Create photorealistic scenes from text descriptions
- Edit photos with natural language instructions
- Generate faces of nonexistent people
- Modify existing images seamlessly

**Real threat:**
- Fabricated "evidence" (photos of events that didn't happen)
- Impersonation through generated headshots
- Manipulated context

**Practical limits:**
- Artifacts often detectable (for now)
- Provenance and context still matter
- Reverse image search still works on authentic components
- Metadata often reveals generation

---

[screen 9]

## AI for Audio and Video: The "Deepfake" Question

**Current capabilities:**
- Voice cloning from small samples (impressive)
- Face swapping in video (variable quality)
- Lip-sync manipulation (improving)
- Full synthetic video (still limited)

**The media narrative:**
- "Anyone can create fake video of anyone"
- "You can't trust video evidence"

**The reality:**
- High-quality video deepfakes still require effort
- Real-time deepfakes exist but have tells
- Most video manipulation is simpler (selective editing, false context)
- Audio cloning is more advanced than video synthesis

---

[screen 10]

## Assessing AI Claims: The Evidence Ladder

When you encounter claims about AI-generated content, classify the evidence:

**Strong signals:**
- Confirmed AI tool artifacts by technical analysis
- Provenance data showing generation source
- Creator admission or platform attribution
- Multiple independent technical assessments

**Medium signals:**
- Stylistic indicators consistent with AI
- Image artifacts visible on close inspection
- Account behavior patterns suggesting automation
- Content volume inconsistent with human capacity

**Weak signals:**
- "It looks AI-generated"
- "The style seems off"
- "This is too polished to be real"
- Absence of provenance (could be anything)

---

[screen 11]

## Common Analytical Errors

**Error 1: Everything suspicious is AI**
- "This campaign seems sophisticated, must be AI"
- Reality: Sophisticated operations existed before AI

**Error 2: AI detection tools are definitive**
- "The detector said 90% AI-generated"
- Reality: Detection tools have significant false positive/negative rates

**Error 3: AI content is automatically more dangerous**
- "AI-generated, therefore high priority"
- Reality: Impact depends on reach and resonance, not production method

**Error 4: Absence of AI artifacts proves authenticity**
- "No AI detected, therefore genuine"
- Reality: AI detection is imperfect; human-created content can also be false

## Practical Scenario

**Situation**: A video surfaces of a political candidate making controversial statements. Critics claim it's a deepfake. Supporters claim it's genuine leaked footage. You have 3 hours before your outlet needs to decide whether to report.

**Your task:**
1. Assess authenticity (what evidence would you seek?)
2. Rate confidence (with available evidence)
3. Recommend action (report, investigate more, or pass)

What you don't do: Claim "deepfake" or "authentic" without supporting evidence.

---

[screen 13]

## Working the Scenario

**Step 1: Source assessment**
- Where did video first appear? (Original source = medium signal)
- Who is promoting it? (Cui bono isn't proof, but context matters)
- What's the provenance chain? (Each step degrades reliability)

**Step 2: Technical analysis (if time permits)**
- Facial movement consistency
- Audio-visual sync
- Lighting and shadow consistency
- Background element coherence
- Known AI artifacts

**Step 3: Context verification**
- Was the candidate at claimed location/time?
- Do statements align with known positions?
- Any corroborating or contradicting evidence?

**Step 4: Confidence rating**
- Multiple strong signals → higher confidence either way
- Medium signals only → acknowledge uncertainty
- Weak/conflicting signals → more investigation or don't report

## Sample Assessment

"A 47-second video shows Candidate X stating 'I support policy Y.' Analysis:

**Source**: First appeared on anonymous Telegram channel, then amplified on X/Twitter by partisan accounts. No original source identified.

**Technical**: Lip-sync appears consistent. No obvious deepfake artifacts on initial review. Professional analysis would require time we don't have.

**Context**: Statement contradicts Candidate X's documented positions. No corroborating appearance at claimed venue.

**Assessment**: Authenticity uncertain. Technical indicators inconclusive. Contextual factors raise questions.

**Confidence**: Low. Neither authentic nor deepfake confirmed.

**Recommendation**: Do not report as fact. If covering, present as 'unverified video' with authentication caveats. Continue investigation."

---

[screen 15]

## The "Liar's Dividend" Problem

When deepfakes become possible, authentic footage becomes deniable.

**The dynamic:**
- Any embarrassing video can be dismissed as "deepfake"
- "Plausible deniability" expands for genuine recordings
- This happens whether or not deepfakes are actually used

**This is already happening:**
- Politicians have claimed authentic recordings are fake
- "It's AI" becomes universal excuse

**Implication:**
- Deepfake capability harms truth even when not deployed
- Authentication infrastructure becomes more important
- Context and corroboration matter more than technical analysis

---

## AI-Enabled Amplification

Beyond content creation, AI changes distribution:

**Automated engagement:**
- AI-powered bots with more human-like behavior
- Conversational agents that respond contextually
- Pattern variation to evade simple detection

**Targeting optimization:**
- AI analyzes which content performs
- Automatic A/B testing at scale
- Rapid iteration toward effective messaging

**But remember:**
- Sophisticated bots still exhibit behavioral patterns
- Account-level signals remain relevant
- Platform detection also uses AI

The arms race is real, but detection isn't defeated.

---

[screen 17]

## The Personalization Threat

Most discussed, least deployed (so far):

**The theory:**
- AI analyzes your beliefs, fears, preferences
- Generates content specifically designed for you
- Hyper-persuasive individualized manipulation

**Current reality:**
- Requires extensive data on individuals
- Computational cost scales with personalization
- Still experimental in information operations
- Advertising already does crude versions

**Watch for:**
- Targeted phishing using personal details
- Tailored narratives for specific communities
- A/B tested messaging for different segments

This is a developing capability, not yet routine in FIMI operations.

[screen 18]

## What AI Means for Response

**Gen 2 (Debunking):**
- AI creates more volume to debunk
- But AI can also assist fact-checking
- Prioritization becomes more important

**Gen 3 (Prebunking):**
- Inoculating against AI-specific techniques
- Teaching critical evaluation for synthetic media
- "This could be AI-generated" as mental habit

**Gen 4 (Moderation):**
- AI detection as input for platform decisions
- Behavioral signals often more reliable than content analysis
- Policy decisions about AI content disclosure

**Gen 5 (Interaction):**
- Building resilience that doesn't depend on authentication
- Community-based verification
- Trust networks that survive AI capabilities

---

[screen 19]

## Stop Rules for AI Assessment

Know when you've done enough analysis:

**Stop when:**
- Evidence tier is clear (strong/medium/weak)
- Additional analysis unlikely to change confidence
- Time would be better spent on response decisions
- You've documented what's known and unknown

**Don't chase:**
- Perfect technical certainty (rarely achievable)
- "Proving" it's AI when behavior matters more
- Every possible artifact or indicator

The goal is accurate assessment under uncertainty, not forensic proof.

---

[screen 20]

## Avoiding Hype

The AI/disinformation discourse contains significant hype:

**Be skeptical of:**
- "AI will make truth impossible"
- "Detection is hopeless"
- "Everything online is fake"
- Specific claims without evidence

**Maintain perspective:**
- AI is a tool, not magic
- Most manipulation doesn't require AI
- Detection and defense are also advancing
- Human judgment remains essential

Your job: calm analysis, not panic amplification.

## Module Assessment

**Scenario**: Your organization receives a tip that a widely shared image showing protestors destroying property is AI-generated. The tipster claims "obvious artifacts" but provides no analysis. The image has reached 500,000 views.

**Task (12 minutes):**

1. List what you would check to assess AI generation claims
2. Classify potential findings as strong/medium/weak signals
3. Write a 3-sentence assessment assuming you find only medium signals
4. What action would you recommend?
5. Identify one thing you explicitly will NOT claim without strong evidence

**Scoring:**
- Penalize certainty without evidence
- Credit systematic approach
- Reward acknowledgment of detection limitations

---

[screen 22]

## Key Takeaways

- AI does change information manipulation: production costs, speed, personalization potential
- AI doesn't change: distribution dynamics, human psychology, fundamental detection approaches
- "AI-generated" is a claim requiring evidence, not an assumption
- Detection tools are imperfect; behavioral signals often more reliable than content analysis
- The "liar's dividend" means AI capability harms truth even when not deployed
- Avoid both naive dismissal and apocalyptic hype
- Your response should match evidence tier, not worst-case assumptions

AI changes the game. It doesn't end it.
