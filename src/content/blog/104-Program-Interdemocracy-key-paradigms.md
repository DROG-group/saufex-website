## Stage one
The precondition of collective intelligence in democracy is engineered independence at the input stage. The independence is empowered by a reversal of the information flow paradigm: not data to apps but apps to data. For individuals formulating their perspective in writing and submitting it, listening to others after they have formulated and submitted their perspective, and being listened to after others have formulated and submitted their perspective is part of their autopoiesis within a setting of “ma”. 
## Stage two
The second stage entails facilitated deliberation producing recommendations based on the perspectives submitted. This facilitation rests on active care (Levinasian ethical) and is experience-maximalization centered (Joshua Greene-inspired utilitarianism) in which experience is defined as the experience of autonomy, belonging, and achievement, and negative experiences outweigh positive experiences. Basic mechanisms of the deliberation stage are constructive confrontation and voting.
