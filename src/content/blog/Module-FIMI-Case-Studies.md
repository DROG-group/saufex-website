# Module: FIMI Case Studies


[screen 1]

Abstract concepts become concrete through specific examples. This module examines well-documented FIMI operations to illustrate tactics, impacts, and lessons learned.

These aren't hypothetical threats - they're documented operations that targeted democratic societies, with real consequences.

[screen 2]

## Case Study 1: 2016 US Election

Perhaps the most studied FIMI operation, Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election demonstrated sophisticated multi-platform coordination.

**Actors**: Internet Research Agency (IRA), GRU military intelligence

**Tactics**:
- Fake social media personas (both left and right-wing)
- Targeted ads to swing state voters
- Organization of real-world events
- Hack-and-leak operations (DNC emails)
- Amplification of divisive content

**Impact**: Millions of engagements, mainstream media coverage of leaked materials, potential influence on close election

**Lessons**: Multi-platform coordination, long-term planning (IRA accounts built over years), exploiting existing polarization

## Case Study 2: Brexit Referendum

The 2016 UK referendum on EU membership involved multiple foreign influence operations.

**Documented activities**:
- Russian accounts amplifying both Leave and Remain to increase division
- Targeting Scottish independence narratives
- Amplifying anti-immigrant sentiment
- Creating appearance of organic grassroots movements

**Unique factors**:
- Short campaign period limited detection
- Less robust platform monitoring than in US
- Intersecting with domestic disinformation

**Lessons**: FIMI doesn't necessarily support one side - sowing division can be the objective itself

## Case Study 3: Ukraine-Related Operations

Russian FIMI operations regarding Ukraine demonstrate sustained, multi-year campaigns.

**2014-2022: Pre-invasion**
- "Ukraine is failed state" narratives
- Amplifying corruption allegations
- "Nazi" and "fascist" labeling of Ukrainian government
- Questioning Ukrainian national identity
- MH17 disinformation (multiple contradictory explanations)

**2022-present: During invasion**
- False flag narratives (claiming Ukraine attacked itself)
- Denial of war crimes despite evidence
- Justification narratives
- Anti-NATO messaging to European audiences
- Targeting Western support and resolve

**Lessons**: Long-term narrative preparation before kinetic operations, integration of information warfare with military action

[screen 5]

## Case Study 4: COVID-19 Infodemic

The pandemic became a massive FIMI opportunity for multiple actors.

**Russian operations**:
- Amplifying anti-vaccine content
- Promoting conspiracy theories
- Discrediting Western vaccines while promoting Sputnik V
- Amplifying pandemic denialism

**Chinese operations**:
- Defending regime's pandemic response
- Spreading theories about US origins of virus
- Amplifying criticism of Western pandemic management

**Iranian operations**:
- Anti-Western pandemic narratives
- Bioweapon conspiracy theories

**Lessons**: Crises create information chaos that FIMI operations exploit; public health becomes information battleground

## Case Study 5: French Presidential Elections (2017)

Russian-linked operations targeting Emmanuel Macron's campaign demonstrated sophisticated tactics.

**Operation**:
- Macron campaign hack and leak days before election
- False narratives about Macron's personal life
- Amplification through US alt-right networks before spreading to France
- Timed for maximum impact with minimum response time

**Response**:
- French media maintained blackout period despite leaks
- Campaign had prepared by providing false documents among real ones
- Swift attribution and exposure

**Lessons**: Pre-bunking and preparation can limit impact; election integrity requires defending information space

## Case Study 6: German Elections (2017)

Multiple operations targeted German federal elections, though with more limited success than in other countries.

**Attempts**:
- Lisa case (false story about refugee sexual assault)
- Anti-refugee disinformation
- Support for AfD (far-right party)
- Hack-and-leak attempts

**Why limited success**:
- Strong German media literacy
- Robust fact-checking
- Language barrier (Russian operators less fluent in German)
- Platform and government coordination
- Public awareness after 2016 US/UK experiences

**Lessons**: Preparedness and resilience reduce FIMI effectiveness; not all operations succeed

[screen 8]

## Case Study 7: Catalonia Independence Referendum (2017)

Russian accounts amplified tensions around Catalonia's independence referendum in Spain.

**Activities**:
- Amplifying both separatist and unionist content to increase conflict
- Creating appearance of international support for independence
- Amplifying violent imagery from police response
- Parallel to strategy in Ukraine (supporting separatism in adversary states)

**Lessons**: Regional separatist movements within EU are FIMI targets; the goal is often destabilization rather than specific outcome

[screen 9]

## Case Study 8: "Operation Secondary Infektion"

A long-running Russian operation discovered in 2019 demonstrated sophisticated forgery and amplification.

**Tactics**:
- Creating fake documents appearing to be from US, UK, and other sources
- Publishing on blogs and forums
- Attempting to get mainstream media to report

**Notable forgeries**:
- Fake Integrity Initiative documents
- False NATO documents
- Fabricated intelligence reports

**Why interesting**: Operation ran for years with limited success - most forgeries were ignored or quickly debunked

**Lessons**: Quantity doesn't ensure quality; sophisticated operations can still fail when targeting aware audiences

[screen 10]

## Case Study 9: COVID Lab Leak Narrative

The laboratory origin theory for COVID-19 demonstrates the complexity of FIMI around uncertain issues.

**Timeline**:
- Early 2020: Natural origin consensus among scientists
- Chinese dismissal of any origin investigation
- Russian and Chinese amplification of bioweapon theories
- 2021: Lab leak hypothesis gains some scientific credibility
- Ongoing: Mix of legitimate scientific debate and FIMI operations

**Challenges**:
- Distinguishing legitimate questions from disinformation
- Foreign actors amplifying genuine scientific uncertainty
- Politicization of scientific questions

**Lessons**: FIMI is most effective when exploiting genuine uncertainty; line between foreign manipulation and legitimate debate can blur

[screen 11]

## Case Study 10: Operation Doppelgänger

An ongoing (as of 2024-2026) operation creating fake versions of legitimate media websites.

**Method**:
- Creating fake websites mimicking legitimate news outlets
- Publishing false articles on these sites
- Sharing via social media to create confusion
- Some articles mix real reporting with inserted false claims

**Targets**: German, French, and other European media outlets

**Detection**: Researchers and platforms identified network through coordination patterns

**Lessons**: Attribution and exposure reduce but don't eliminate operations; actors continue operating even after exposure

[screen 12]

## Common Patterns Across Cases

Several themes emerge from documented operations:

- **Multi-platform coordination**: Successful operations rarely stay on one platform
- **Long-term investment**: Most sophisticated operations involve years of preparation
- **Exploitation of real tensions**: FIMI amplifies existing divisions rather than creating new ones
- **Adaptation**: Actors learn from failures and platform countermeasures
- **Persistence**: Exposure doesn't end operations; actors regenerate and continue
- **Increasing sophistication**: Tactics evolve toward more believable, harder-to-detect methods

[screen 13]

## The Attribution Challenge

Many cases demonstrate attribution difficulties:

- Actors use proxies and cutouts
- Technical evidence (IP addresses, etc.) can be spoofed
- Determining state direction vs independent actors is difficult
- Political implications of attribution require high confidence

Later module covers attribution in detail, but these cases show why it's challenging.

[screen 14]

## Impact Assessment Challenges

Determining actual impact of FIMI operations is difficult:

- Correlation doesn't prove causation (would Brexit/Trump have happened without FIMI?)
- Measuring attitude change is complex
- Separating foreign from domestic manipulation
- Accounting for organic spread after initial seeding

These cases affected public discourse, but quantifying electoral or policy impact remains contentious.

## Lessons for Defense

These cases inform defense strategies:

**Prevention**:
- Awareness and media literacy reduce vulnerability
- Platform policies and enforcement matter
- International coordination enables swift response

**Detection**:
- Pattern recognition across platforms
- Linguistic and behavioral analysis
- Researcher and civil society monitoring

**Response**:
- Swift public attribution
- Platform removal of inauthentic networks
- Fact-checking and debunking
- Supporting quality journalism

**Resilience**:
- Societal cohesion reduces exploitation opportunities
- Trust in institutions matters
- Education builds long-term resilience

Each case provides lessons that strengthen collective defense against future operations.
